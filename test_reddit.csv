Do not cut off any of the remaining threads.  Gently glue down the remaining threads across the top edge of the bracelet (left to right as it is pictured.  Place on a piece of wax paper (parchment appear will do) and leave it alone for 24 hours.  \n\nThe slide tube end you have should have an opening at the end (flap) and a slit along the length.  After the threads have dried slide 1 or 2 rows of the beads inside the tube.  If you can fit 2 rows I would do it, I know you might lose a bit of the design, but it will help hold the tube on the bracelet.  Once you determine how many rows to insert, place a small amount of glue along the length of the beads, insert into the tube.  Wipe off any excess glue and again place it on the paper.  Leave it alone for 24 hours. \n\nAfter drying gently tug on the bracelet to see if it comes out of the tube.  If secure, close and glue the end cap on.  Leave alone again for a day.  The bracelet should be repaired. Just a note -Do not use super glue on this.  It will become very brittle and will probably break.', 'This isn‚Äôt a big problem.

It also has acceleration a rightwards.\n* Right weight has a weight force 25g down, and tension T2 up. Also acceleration a downwards.\n\nThen write down the equations, mostly from Newtons law F=MA.\n\n* Left: T1 - 10g = 10a\n* Center, vertical direction: 80g - R = 0\n* Center, left to right direction: T2 - T1 - 0.001R = 80a\n* Right: 25g - T2 = 25a\n\nThis gives us 4 equations, and 4 unknowns T1, T2, R and a.

The left string pulls the 10kg object up with the same magnitude of force as it pulls the 80kg object to the left.\n\n.\n\nThus we only have a few variables when diagramming the forces on each object:\n\n25 kg \\* acceleration = (weight of 25 kg) - (right tension)\n\n80 kg \\* acceleration = (right tension) - (left tension) - (friction)\n\n10 kg \\* acceleration = (left tension) - (weight of 10 kg)\n\n.\n\nAdding these three equations together, we find that the tension forces, which are internal to the system, both cancel out.

He knew since at least 1940 that the partition of India was an inevitable conclusion, considering that muslims by and large want a separate state. He castigates the Congress leaders for wilfully ignoring the demands of the muslims. He also lambasts muslims for demanding unreasonable concessions in provinces where they were majority. In the end, only a divided country could lead to peace and progress of both communities in his view. And in the case of India, it has been at least partially true.\n\nCongress\' vision of a so-called United India was wishfulness, ignorant at best or delusional at worst of the actual reality on ground level. Whether Congress or rather the liberal wing of it liked to admit it or not, it was a party whose base was overwhelmingly Hindus, mostly caste Hindus but substantial backward castes too supported it. It unreasonably liked to call itself a party for all people despite muslims at best tolerating it, being indifferent to it or since 1936-37 onwards, actively opposing it. The Muslim league had by 1945 become THE party for Muslims, advocating for a separate muslim homeland where Islamic principles would apply. (Disregard any and all propaganda that Jinnah was some sort of liberal democrat who wanted a secular Pakistan. He had, for a decade and more, prior to partition made his position very clear that Pakistan would be ruled in according with Islamic principles, that Koran and Sunnah would be basis on which Pakistan would be built). \n\n\n\nA good source to read is obviously Dr Ambedkar\'s classic yet under-read and under-appreciated, ""Pakistan or The Partition of India""\n\nFor Jinnah, his biography - ‚ÄòJinnah: His Successes, Failures and Role in History‚Äô by Ishtiaq Ahmed is a great read.', 'Obligatory StoneToss is a Nazi comment.', 'obligitory Stonetoss is a neo-nazi']",0.097234632034632,,0,19,0.0,11,15,4,11,2024,HistoryMemes-1gru8z1.jpeg,3

There may be an issue with each of the individual components that goes into the built in gain.\n\nFirst the basis and the fair market value.\n\nYour ""basis"" is essentially the amount of your contribution. For example, when you start a partnership, your basis is the amount you invest in the partnership. The basis can be increased or decreased over time by earnings and distributions.\n\nYour basis in a piece of property is how much you paid for it.\n\nHowever, basis does not change based on changes in ""value"". For example, if you have a business that you invested $100 into, and on day 1 before any income or expenses or anything, everyone in the world thinks you have the best business on the planet and wants to buy it from you for 1 million, your basis is still $100 even though the market value may be 1 million.\n\nThis applies to property as well. Property values typically go up. So, if you buy a property for $60,000 and it is now worth $100,000 even though you didn\'t add any more investment into the property, your basis is still $60,000 even though the fair market value is $100,000\n\nI wanted to clarify the above because based on your phrasing of the question it wasn\'t clear if you took all of this away when looking at the problem the professor solved. You mentioned the first partner got in for $60,000 and fair market values but some of the information might have been a little mixed together.\n\nI can\'t tell you for sure what happened in the problem since not all of the details are written down but I can make some assumptions. It looks like partner A and partner B got in at the same time. They started the partnership with a total contribution of $150,000. B contributed 1/3 ($50,000) in cash and A contributed 2/3 ($100,000) in property. However, this is the key part, A bought the property for $60,000 so, even though he contributed property of $100,000 there is a built-in gain of $40,000. The gain is built into the contribution.\n\nNow, sometime down the line, the partnership sells the property. It is now worth $200,000. A bought the property for $60,000 so the realized gain is $140,000. However, A had a built in gain of $40,000 so that is attributed directly to A. The remaining $100,000 of the gain is split between A and B by their ownership. Since A owns 2/3, A\'s portion of that gain is $66,666. Add that to the $40,000 built-in gain and A will be liable for taxes on $106,666 in gains, while B will be responsible for $33,333.\n\nI don\'t know why A got rounded to 66,666 in this example rather than 66,667 but that\'s the way it was done. Hope you can make it through that wall of text and you find it helpful.']",0.1294953703703703,,0,27,0.0,22,18,0,11,2024,HomeworkHelp-1guhbgg.jpeg,1

1gnqzuv,Leathercraft,Prepping for my first market next weekend! Any last minute tips or things I should add to the table?,401,0,401,1.0,AmblingHobbies,2024-11-10 02:57:47,70,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leathercraft/comments/1gnqzuv/prepping_for_my_first_market_next_weekend_any/,https://i.redd.it/tcyku16lozzd1.jpeg,jpeg,3024x4032,4115049,763032,Creative,"['not a seller, so my advice comes from a buyers perspective, whatever that‚Äôs worth. \n\nmake sure prices are clearly labelled, and if this is a more leather-centric fair, maybe details about the type of leather used. keep flashy things in front to catch their eye along with cheaper things that they‚Äôre more likely to buy. and make sure to make yourself look approachable! stand instead of sitting behind a table, and practice your best salesperson grin! best of luck, we‚Äôre rooting for you!', ""1. Display. Draw them in. Toss stuff on milk crates, cupcake shelves work nice for wallets, jewelry display racks are cheap and or easy to build. These markets tend to have a ton of booths, so you gotta draw them in quick and have items that hold their attention. \n\n2. Prices clearly marked, within market average for those products, and a wide range of items and prices. Someone may want a $10 bookmark, and someone may want a $500 messenger bag. Hit each price tier.\n\n3. Have some overpriced centerpiece. For me it was a laptop bag hanging right in the center. Would always bring crowds in to check it out. \n\n4. Toss up a free smells sign. Everyone loves the smell of leather. Shows some humor and immediately makes you more approachable. \n\n5. Make conversation and don't put put business cards for them to just take away from your standing area. Have them engage you in conversation. Folks tend to take business cards to be nice with no real interest in buying. If they spark up a conversation, then inquire about a card this is your time to tell them you're open for commissions and see what they are looking for. This is where I got a majority of my sales. \n\n6. This is a personal trick I had. Target kids with free bookmarks. Ask them if they read and let them pick out a bookmark. They love it and the parents were more inclined to buy something after their kid got something too.\n\n7. Bonus tips -  bring some pre punched items to sew while you are there. Folks will watch and understand why your wallet is $80 vs the $30 Levi's one at a store. When doing belts, bring a shit belt you got laying around from a department store and cut it in half to show the inside of that belt compared to what you are selling."", ""Price tags... if you are including tax put the total price on the tags. Make sure they are legible.\n\nLeather tools. If your belts don't have holes, you will need a punch to custom fit them to your customers. Bring something to work on while you are there. People are more likely to stop if they see you working on something. \n\n\nIngage your customers. \nSay hello to everyone who comes by. \nBe prepared to answer questions, lots of them. \nThe most common is 'did you make these yourself?' \nAsk if there is something particular they are looking for.\n\nIf you are inclined, take custom orders if there is a specific color or style they are looking for but didn't see.\nGet specific information from them (name, address, phone, color, size, quantity). \n\nMake sure you get half the money down on any custom order. (There is nothing worse than making something for someone and getting ghosted when its complete.)\n\nIf you are serious about vending, look into getting a Square reader for your phone, so you can accept credit and debit cards.\nhttps://squareup.com \n\nI've been vending leather for 20 years at renaissance faires, pirate festivals and bike shows. When the card readers came out I got Square and it increased my sales by a minimum of 35%. \n\nMessage me if you have sales questions  and I will help you all I can."", 'I assume youll be finishing the belts on site? Thats always a good idea bc you make a lot of noise and draw attention. Most folks at evens will impulse buy stuff from 20-50 bucks, so having lots of stuff in that range is good (looks like youre prepared for that). Totes are also a good one. \n\nI think the setup is going to be more important than your inventory at the moment. Be sure there is a sign of some kind with your business name or contact. Not everyone wants a business card. Some folks will just take a picture of your info. As others have said, dont just lay it all on a table. Make things easy to see and have multiple levels of display. Also a nice blanket/table covering is a good touch, but make it something neutral colored so the leather still stands out and the underlying covering isnt distracting. \n\nLighter cases sell. Youll want more than one of those. \n\nAlso, having some kind of packaging option like little jute bags is a nice tough. Bonus points if you can stamp your logo on it. \n\nBe sure to have a comfortable chair, water, snacks, and plenty of small bills for change. Obv a square reader or way to take credit cards. \n\nBe sure to be friendly to your neighbors...and open to bartering. A lot of trades take place at events and its excellent networking. Collabing with other people is often great exposure, especially since those folks have their own social networks/customer bases already. \n\nIf you can bring someone with you to help, that is a big win. Usually your neighbors can watch your table if you need to run to the bathroom real quick, but that works better if you know them for more than five minutes. There will be times when you will have multiple customers so having someone to help that can sell something while you have a conversation with a customer is a big win. You can bribe your friends to do this with goodies. \n\nSome guys like to add some of their tools to the display. Im not really a fan of it, but if you have a nice maul or something is can definitely spark a conversation. \n\nBe nice. Stay hydrated. Days at markets can be a lot of fun but they are almost always also exhausting. Dont haggle/cheapen your goods. They have value. If somebody wants to buy several things, then yeah, maybe make them a good deal. But people will tell you your prices or too high or say they can buy something at walmart for 10 bucks. Tell them where the nearest walmart can be found. \n\nIf there are food trucks/food vendors around, get some snacks from them and tell them where you are at. The more vendors you befriend, the more will send stuff your way. I used to set up across from a vegan kitchen and bought breakfast from them every week. We were friendly even though I was slanging dead animals right next to them. \n\nAnd if there are other leatherworkers, be friendly. They probably do different things than you. I worked a weekly market with three and we all had different styles and we all sent each other customers who were looking for something different. \n\nGood luck out there!', 'Off topic but at first my brain wanted to know why there‚Äôs a pile of mini dynamite sticks in the back üòÇ']",0.2180601638504864,,0,100,0.0833333333333333,2,10,6,11,2024,Leathercraft-1gnqzuv.jpeg,0

The goose has a particular fondness for wheat ‚Äî and, consequently, a habit of getting shot at by farmers.   \n  \nAlthough often a nuisance to African farmers, colonising Europeans thought it looked neat and so the British brought it back to England in the 17th century and it's been slowly spreading over the Isles since. It was then introduced to mainland Europe, where its range expanded more rapidly, and it's now found as an invasive species throughout the continent.   \n  \nIt has also been brought to parts of the Middle East and the United States, where escapees from zoos and aviaries established wild populations.   \n  \nAlthough usually quite placid for geese, between March and July (depending on where they live), male Egyptian geese begin to show off for females with elaborate displays and loud honking.  \n  \nAn Egyptian goose couple will aggressively defend their eggs and chicks ‚Äî most aggressively from other Egyptian geese, since infanticide is sometimes a strategy employed by competing parents.  \n  \nThe female is known to have a far louder honk than the male; sounding [somewhat like maniacal laughter](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/304222).  \n\nIn its native ecosystems, the Egyptian goose breaks up soil while feeding along the ground, helping plants decompose, and acts as a seed disperser.  \n  \nIn foreign ecosystems, however, the Egyptian goose often does more harm than good; possibly limiting the breeding territories of other waterfowl by violently driving them away and even actively drowning other birds.   \n  \nAlthough it's called a goose, this species is most closely related to shelducks; such as the [ruddy shelduck](https://ebird.org/species/rudshe), [South African shelduck](https://ebird.org/species/soashe1), and [radjah shelduck](https://ebird.org/species/radshe1).   \n\n\n**You can learn more about the Egyptian goose on** [**my website here!**](https://www.curiousspecies.com/my-species/es6hd5cxkheldm9-sz66x-jge7j-a4ppy-rlb3j-ct9yc)"", '**Sources:**\n\n[Animal Diversity Web](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Alopochen_aegyptiaca/)\n\n[Audubon](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/egyptian-goose)\n\n[RSPB](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/egyptian-goose)\n\n[Oakland Zoo](https://www.oaklandzoo.org/animals/egyptian-goose)\n\n[British Trust for Ornithology](https://www.bto.org/understanding-birds/birdfacts/egyptian-goose)\n\n[The Wildlife Trusts](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/birds/waterfowl/egyptian-goose)\n\n[British Waterfowl Association](https://www.waterfowl.org.uk/wildfowl/true-ducks/egyptian-goose/)\n\n[Agriculture Victoria](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/biosecurity/pest-animals/exotic-pest-animal-species/birds/egyptian-goose)\n\n[eBird](https://ebird.org/species/egygoo)\n\n[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/72486-Alopochen-aegyptiaca)\n\n[IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22679993/131910647)\n\n[Oiseaux-Birds](https://www.oiseaux-birds.com/card-egyptian-goose.html)\n\n[The Birds of Ancient Egypt](https://books.google.co.th/books?id=prfSEAAAQBAJ&dq=egyptian+geese+significance+egyptian+art&pg=PA62&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=egyptian%20geese%20significance%20egyptian%20art&f=false)', 'They live at my local park. very docile and beautiful creatures', 'Invasive in North America.

The most important application is in data fitting. When the problem has substantial uncertainties in the independent variable (the x variable), then simple regression and least-squares methods have problems; in such cases, the methodology required for fitting errors-in-variables models may be considered instead of that for least squares.([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares))\n\nThe data for this graph is example data. This graph was made for the documentation of a data analysis tool. Here is the corresponding [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/davidkowalk/fitting_toolkit/blob/Stable/docs/manual.md#calculation-of-the-confidence-interval)\n\nThis Graph was made entirely using matplotlib / pyplot.\n\n**What is this, what am I seeing?**\n\nWhen fitting functions we assign a confidence interval (dashed white lines) around that function to represent a 2/3s chance that the actual function lies within that interval. To calculate that interval a probability density around the fit is calculated in the y direction and the top and bottom 1/6th are cut off.\n\nThe density shown is grainy because it is generated by resampling the fit parameters and calculating the resulting density as a histogram.\n\nThis density is normalized y-wise but not x-wise.', 'This is very cool.

I leaned into his regal side with more intricate details, adding ornate gold bangles, layered chains, and an overall more purposeful costume design. One fun new detail the player wanted incorporated is a magical item from his campaign: every morning, he wakes up with an enormous, wild beard that adds to his larger-than-life presence.\n\nPhysically, I refined his build to give him the powerful frame of a strongman ‚Äì broad, muscular, and imposing, with a balance of brute strength and werewolf savagery. His beastly nature is highlighted through his scars and tufts of fur, with his pale skin peeking through in all the right places, and his boar-like tusks add a menacing edge to his already fearsome appearance.\n\nWorking on this was fun, especially with such a clear vision from the player!\n\nLet me know what you think ‚Äì feedback is always welcome!

The ships drew closer, and witnesses described seeing a massive explosion that split the Hood in half, sinking it and leaving only 3 survivors out of the 1,418 men aboard. The damaged Prince of Wales retreated, while the Bismarck was later sunk in a battle against British battleships.\n\nTwo decades prior, in the Battle of Jutland during First World War, three British battlecruisers - the HMS *Indefatigable*, HMS *Queen Mary*, and the ironically named HMS *Invincible* commanded by Admiral Horace Hood - also exploded and sank taking more than 99% of their crews with them. Construction of the *Hood* had just started and was halted so that the design could be altered to try and prevent such a thing for happening again but of course the exact same fate would befall the *Hood* during her battle with the *Bismarck*. It may have indeed just been bad luck but it should be noted that the *Hood* was supposed to have been designed to prevent that exact scenario from happening.\n\nThere‚Äôs a constant cycle of exaggeration followed by over-correction with lots of World War II topics like the *Bismarck*, the Maginot Line, and many others; it‚Äôs correct the *Bismarck* wasn‚Äôt nearly as powerful as 1960‚Äôs American folk songs or Swedish power metal might have implied but it was still a formidable warship that did indeed annihilate the HMS *Hood* after just a few minutes of battle.', 'Yeah Bismarck sunk the Hood but sealed her own fate too.

Its job? Go through a text word by word, compare each word to a predefined dictionary, and flag those that don‚Äôt match. If a word isn‚Äôt found in its database, it marks it as an error.  \n\nBut don‚Äôt expect much detail. No context analysis, no grammar. Just: ""Does this word exist or not?"" As for suggestions, they are sometimes limited or not very accurate.  \n\nBasically, Spell is the old-school spell checker from the early Unix days: useful for spotting simple mistakes, but not suited for complex texts or understanding context. Simple, fast, but very basic!  \n\nIspell, launched in 1983, came to fix the limits of Spell. Unlike its predecessor, it‚Äôs interactive: when it detects a misspelled word, it offers a list of suggestions, and the user can directly choose the correct option or even add the word to a personal dictionary. Plus, it supports multiple languages thanks to specific dictionary files.  \n\n\n\nToday, modern spell checkers go much further. They use tools like the Levenshtein distance to measure differences between words,\n(  For example, to turn ""cat"" into ""bat,"" you just replace the ""c"" with a ""b,"" so the distance is 1.) tokenization to break text into meaningful units, and advanced algorithms capable of analyzing context and grammar. These technologies enable precise and adaptive corrections, far beyond the basic capabilities of their predecessors.', 'For literally the first of its kind, its incredibly impressive', 'I think a ""spell checker"" defines very well what it is capable of and does not pretend to be more ( unlike teslas autopilot which is only a drive assistant in reality)']",0.3168852258852259,,0,32,0.25,12,5,3,12,2024,HistoryMemes-1h77um7.png,3

A seems unlikely because the amino acid (AA) sequence is made up of amino acid residues not bases and is post translation which is far removed from the question. For the same reason E is out. Now the wording is a little tricky in the question and is likely because the professor made the question while referring to a text book that talks about a reference point. Without that context my best bet would be to treat it like a question about promoters and enhancer sequences that are upstream of a reference point like a gene start codon or TATA box which would mean it would have to be on the Transcribed DNA not the resulting mRNA.

I used to have this gorgeous plum shade blush (the brand/exact shade are eluding me rn, but it had a subtle sparkle? Like a muted pinkish plum is the best way I can describe it) that I think would look beautiful on you. You could add a lip color, but I don\'t think you need it. Maybe a liner & a gloss?

The 4 pulled more auburn and the 3 seems to match me the best,  even though you\'d think 5 just from looking online). It\'s great when you have real brows to work with. I personally use an ancient ABH brow powder (it\'s so old I bet it\'s discontinued) and pencil to draw mine on and fill them in to look like hair due to the aforementioned overtweezing. I\'ll also tint what\'s left of mine when i dye my hair and I can not fill them in for a week or 2. \n\n\nSorry for the brow tangent.

I noticed that the newer windows are actually less thermally efficient than the older windows, and it is because each one of them has this track at the bottom, where the window will slide across horizontally.  As part of the track, there is this little channel that actually goes underneath the glass window itself and has holes that lead directly to outside.  Because the channel is underneath the window, there's also only about 1 mm of aluminum (vinyl?) between indoors and outdoors.  This edge obviously is a huge source of thermal loss.\n\nThis channel under the window is not necessary for the sliding mechanism to work.  I don't understand what the point even is?  Why go through the trouble to design a two paned window and then have part of the envelope just be 1 mm of metal?

No matter your thoughts on the work, respect the effort put into making it and be polite when posting. \n\n* Be constructive and detailed. Short, vague comments are unhelpful. Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you hold that opinion: what makes the piece good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?\n\n* Remember design fundamentals. If your feedback is focused on basic principles of design such as hierarchy, flow, balance, and proportion, it will be universally useful. And remember that this is graphic design: the piece should communicate a message or solve a \nproblem. How well does it do that?\n\n* Stay on-topic.

The Sioux were largely nomadic and relied on bison as their main food source, as well as furs, tools, trading materials, etc.  They actually defeated the US in Red Cloud\'s war (which was directly following the US Civil War, so a time when the US really had other stuff to worry about than a war on the frontier of the Dakotas), and they continued to be difficult for the US to subdue, mostly due to lack of enthusiasm for the wars because Dakota was so far away and really not a first or second choice for a lot of settlers when large-scale urbanization was beginning and the Industrial Revolution in the US came into full swing.  \n\nSo rather than fight the Natives directly, they just went for the food supply.  The goal was to exterminate the bison, not just for sport or profit, but specifically to weaken the Plains Natives\' ability to resist.  The quote about ""Every dead buffalo is an Indian gone"" was by no means official government doctrine or anything (and it\'s probably apocryphal, from what I can tell), but it does a good job of conveying that white hunters were exterminating buffalo as a weapon against the Natives, with the tacit approval of the government.  It was, after all, starvation that forced the Lakota Sioux onto reservations to rely on government subsidies (which the US government often didn\'t provide in the full promised amount).  It was starvation that forced the Miniconjou and Hunkpapa to surrender to the US soldiers who proceeded to slaughter them at Wounded Knee.  And it was starvation that forced the end of the Ghost Dance War that the Wounded Knee massacre was committed during.\n\nBut this isn\'t to say there wasn\'t resistance to this.  A lot of people wanted to protect the buffalo, since they were a symbol of the American West and they weren\'t entirely unaware of the ecological impacts that eliminating the largest animal in the American Plains would bring.  But a lot of people were also against exterminating the Natives, wanting them to become ""civilized"" and adopt Christianity and Anglo-Saxon customs (which is still cultural genocide- there were admittedly very few US people who were vocal of the opinion that Indians had a right to their own culture and land to live on).  Wounded Knee was initially seen as retribution for Little Bighorn, but even people at the time recognized that Little Bighorn was a battle where everyone involved were soldiers and Custer\'s contingent went down fighting, and Wounded Knee was a shooting gallery of men and women of all ages who had surrendered and already, mostly, given up their arms.  Even decades earlier, the Trail of Tears had been highly controversial for its brutality.  \n\nPoint being, there was a lot of angles to the buffalo genocide, and it was just one facet of the US-Indian wars.  And this isn\'t even touching on the fact that it wasn\'t as simple as White vs Indian, since the US almost always found allies  amongst the native populations, whether that be entire tribes in official treaties, or individuals who decided for their own reasons that the US was better to side with than other Natives, even of their own tribes (Sitting Bull was killed by an Indian police contingent, and the officer who killed him, Marcellus Red Tomahawk, was Hunkpapa, as was Sitting Bull).', 'Nice, racism.', 'You could have made a good meme about one of the greatest man made tragedies ever seen on this planet but decided to go for the race baiting instead and now people will tune it out.', 'Casual racism is casual.']",0.2741036782923575,,0,27,0.0,19,25,0,11,2024,HistoryMemes-1gzr31j.jpeg,3

It communicates with other serows via scent markings, rubbed onto leaves from tear-shaped scent glands below each of its eyes.  \n  \nIn the past, these serows were more plentiful throughout the lowlands of Japan. But as human populations spread and grew, deforesting land as they went, the serows retreated to higher and higher ground.   \n  \nAs spring arrives and snow melts, the super-abundant [sika deer](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/42210-Cervus-nippon) of Japan make their way up the mountains. They travel in herds ‚Äî grunting, whistling, and barking  ‚Äî moving into the serows\' territories. The serows, naturally very reserved, are too disturbed by the bustle of the deer and must retreat to poorer, but more private places.   \n  \nThe Japanese serow can be active both day and night ‚Äî technically called \'cathemeral\', meaning it is active at irregular intervals.  \n  \nThe serow\'s usual diet is made up of grasses, leaves and fallen acorns. During summer, it eats fallen fruit and blossoming flowers, while in winter, its fare is more meagre; consisting of buds and bark.   \n  \nWhen a serow stands watch from on high, it\'s likely watching out for rival serows. Its predators are sparse; the [Asian black bear](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/418146-Ursus-thibetanus-japonicus) isn\'t really the predatory type (mostly eating a vegetarian diet) and the grey wolves that once hunted in Japan have been extinct since the early 1900s ‚Äî perhaps an instinctual memory of wolves lingers in the serow\'s mind.   \n  \nA more recent predator of the serow was humans. Hunted for meat and fur, and killed by defensive farmers, the Japanese serow was nearly pushed to extinction.   \n  \nThis species was finally granted some protection when it became a \'Natural Monument\' in 1934. Currently listed as a species of \'least concern\', there are estimated to be some 100,000 serows in Japan today.  \n  \nThe territories of male and female serows often overlap. Sometimes a couple will form a monogamous pair, staying together from one breeding season to the next. But, if a male is ousted from his territory, the residing female will go on to breed with the conquering male ‚Äî she is seemingly married to the territory, not to the specific male.   \n  \nIn Japanese, this serow is known as the *kamoshika* (Ê∞àÈπø), literally translating to ""coarse pelt deer"".   \n  \nThe serow features in an odd idiom that goes *\'Kamoshika no yo no ashi\'*, translating to \'legs like a serow\'. Apparently, it is a flattering phrase used to compliment a lady\'s legs ‚Äî a little strange since those of the serow are stout, thick, and hairy.  \n  \nThe serow, despite its Japanese name, is not closely related to deer but is a member of a unique lineage in the Bovidae family (containing cattle, antelope, sheep and goats). The three other serow species are the [Taiwan (or Formosan) serow](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/74144-Capricornis-swinhoei), the [mainland serow](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/74143-Capricornis-sumatraensis), and the [red serow](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/74142-Capricornis-rubidus).  \n  \n**You can learn more about this \'grey ghost\' and its cousins on** [**my website here!**](https://www.curiousspecies.com/my-species/blog-post-title-one-yemxk-m29ek-dhngg-w852d-pr2mn-rx3pm-gm2rj-acerw-wca8h-j9yl6-3hf5w-wypyl-8jlcn-8y34a-we9ft-9mgen-9a7hw-yg4t5-4n388-g9r3t-b4fp9-y5yaj)', '**Sources:**\n\n[Animal Diversity Web](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Capricornis_crispus/)\n\n[Zoo Granby](https://www.zoodegranby.com/en/animals/japanese-serow)\n\n[Japan Nature Guides](https://www.japannatureguides.com/japanese-serow/)\n\n[Japan Travel](https://www.japan.travel/en/sg/jbyj-blog/seeking-the-spirit-of-the-forest-1/)\n\n[Japan Experience](https://www.japan-experience.com/plan-your-trip/to-know/traveling-japan/japanese-serow)\n\n[Nozawa Holidays](https://www.nozawaholidays.com/news/how-to-spot-kamoshika/)\n\n[IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/3811/22151909)\n\n[Unique spatial behavior of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) in the open mountains of Mt.

The spaced organisation of the Roman maniple allowed the retreating Romans to escape the Macedonians, who in turn fell back at the sight of the Roman battle lines forming up.Flamininus commanded from his left legion and advanced with it, leaving his right in reserve.\n\n\nAs the battle continued, an unnamed tribune, upon realising their position at the exposed rear of the Macedonian right wing, detached 20 maniples (approximately 2,500 infantry) and sent them into the rear of the Macedonian phalanx. Being quickly cut down due to the inflexibility of the formation, the Macedonian phalanx disintegrated. Some were simply killed where they stood, others pointed their sarissas directly upwards in a sign of surrender that the Romans either ignored or failed to understand. Thus, the slaughter continued, only being stopped due to the intervention of Flamininus Phillip, along with a small number of cavalry, he fled the battle with his escort, returning to Macedonian territory. Plutarch would later say;\n\n*Philip, however, got safely away, and for this the Aetolians were to blame, who fell to sacking and plundering the enemy's camp while the Romans were still pursuing, so that when the Romans came back to it they found nothing there.*\n\n‚Äî\u200aThe Parallel Lives, The Life of Titus Flamininus, Volume X, p.345"", 'Answer to the ""how you stop this"" question was crystal-clear to everyone at the time: flank them, shoot them or get them on less than-perfectly-flat ground.

In recent years, human activity caused a hole in the ozone layer killing many of the sky's apex predators. As a result, smaller beasts became overpopulated and started attacking human settlements. As a result, a global organization called the Atmospheric Defense Corps is created to combat this threat, utilizing various mechs and fighter jets.)\n\nV-06 Symbiosis or\xa0*Caelopias astrocanthus*\xa0is a Leviathan level atmospheric beast and inhabits the ozone layer. It is a species of Chondrichthyes and measures 250m in length. Currently only one female specimen is known to exist codenamed ‚ÄúDakuwaqa‚Äù. It is speculated to have been existed since the Silurian period, 420 millions years ago. It was first sighted by in 19‚ñà‚ñà by CIA SR-71 pilot Lt.‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà above the Soviet Union. Subsequently the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program or HAARP has been established to monitor the movements of V-06. Highly territorial, V-06 may attack any large vehicles or organisms indiscriminately.\xa0\n\nV-06‚Äôs entire body length is lined with hundred of thousands of electrocytes allowing it to produce high amounts of bioelectricity. V-06 generates a passive electromagnetic field around its body allowing it to sense its surrounding\xa0 environment. The electrically charged particles created by V-06‚Äôs field interacts with the atmosphere causing auroras to form all around the organism. This also generates powerful EMPs around the organism, which poses a major threat to global infrastructures.\n\nV-06 possesses a long caudal fin which forms half of its body length. It hunts by using this tail as a whip, stunning and killing its prey in a way similar to thresher sharks (*Alopias sp*.) In fact researchers observed it targeting entire schools of\xa0*Macroparamecium*, its main source of prey, stunning multiple individuals with its tail before consumption. \xa0V-06 may also infuse its tail with bioelectricity exponentially increasing its attack potency.\n\nV-06 maintains a mutualistic relationship with a smaller atmospheric beast\xa0*Altoremora symbios*\xa0also known as Sky rods of Skyfish. These organisms help V-06 by feeding on its parasites and in exchange receive leftover food and protection against predators. they can attach to V-06 using their suction pad on their head.\xa0*A.symbios*\xa0are also immune to V-06‚Äôs bioelectricity and are capable of generating their own bioelectricity.They can further increase the range and power of V-06‚Äôs electrogenesis by acting as lightning rods, multiplying V-06‚Äôs bioelectric capabilities. V-06 maintains\xa0 telepathic connections with A.symbios allowing both to coordinate precise electric attacks. It has been suggested that V-06 is capable of creating telepathic bonds with other organisms although further research is needed.\n\nV-06 is considered an apex predator and helps keep populations of its prey in check. As a result some researchers\xa0 consider V-06 a protector being which maintains balance in the atmospheric ecosystem. The Atmospheric Defense Corps is still undecided on the status of V-06.""]",0.087449183130699,,0,50,0.0,14,4,2,12,2024,Drawing-1h6hx48.jpeg,0

No matter your thoughts on the work, respect the effort put into making it and be polite when posting. \n\n* Be constructive and detailed. Short, vague comments are unhelpful. Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you hold that opinion: what makes the piece good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?\n\n* Remember design fundamentals. If your feedback is focused on basic principles of design such as hierarchy, flow, balance, and proportion, it will be universally useful. And remember that this is graphic design: the piece should communicate a message or solve a \nproblem. How well does it do that?\n\n* Stay on-topic.

I am designing a steam capsule image for a game I am working on. Some context first as it will be valueable for feedback: The game is called Timeless Treasures: The Lost Artifact. It puts the player in the shoes of a time traveler who is on a quest to restore the ancient artifact (made of different color cristals). For that he travels to various eras (ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece, China, Mayans - hence the glyphs in the background), solves puzzles to find hidden items and restore the artifact piece by piece. I am a total amateur when it comes to design so wanted to check with some experienced crowd. The feel should be a bit mysterious, a combination of time travel and ancient elements. The capsule needs to be eye catching and fairly stand out so that when scrolling there is a chance for catching the viewer's attention.

The answer, depicted here, is a conditionally perceived shade of beige. In computer parlance: #FFF8E7. To determine this, astronomers computationally averaged the light emitted by one of the larger samples of galaxies analyzed: the 200,000 galaxies of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. The resulting cosmic spectrum has some emission in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but a single perceived composite color. This color has become much less blue over the past 10 billion years, indicating that redder stars are becoming more prevalent.

He raped his sister-in-law based on the dubious claim his brother had raped Wenxuan\'s wife (though the brother was still a jerkass even if the incident never happened). He was also a sex maniac who would have sex with multiple women at once. He raped every woman in his family. One concubine refused and he killed her with his own hands. He even beheaded a woman for feeling sad about her husband\'s death. When one of his commanders died he blamed the man\'s lieutenant Lu Huili, had Lu killed by being cut open, and ordered the soldiers to eat Lu\'s internal organs. A man snubbed him, so Wenxuan had the man beaten to death then beheaded all twenty of his sons. \n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nAs described by Sima Guang in his *Zizhi Tongjian*:\n\n*... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (ÂäâÊ°ÉÊûù) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles\' and imperial officials\' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, ""How is the Son of Heaven like?"" The woman responded, ""He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven."" He beheaded her.*\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li\'s mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk, mostly by dismemberment, but sometimes by burning or drowning. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards‚Äîif Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHe died of alcoholism-related illness at age 32-33. He was apparently at peace with his death.', '[deleted]', 'The Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty: Hold my red lead (made from the menstrual blood of virgin teenage girls fed only mulberry leaves and rainwater)', 'Crown Prince Sado: the original (psychopathic) dick in a box\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_Sado']",0.0876963019250253,,0,53,0.0,18,26,1,11,2024,HistoryMemes-1h0jm9k.jpeg,3

Engineers studied it for industrial purposes, and a LOT of manufacturing of just about anything that‚Äôs a semi-solid at some point from clay to candy is based on the multiple sphincters of horses. So, just imagine how snooty they‚Äôd be when they found that out. Imagine that one asshole centaur friend who, while you‚Äôre watching a video on how they make candy canes or cosmetics or whatever, points at the screen and goes ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs the machine humans built based on how my ass works.‚Äù\n\nHorse babies will do little runs hours after they‚Äôre born. Human babies are practically ragdolls. Now imagine the horse half doing little happy zoomies while the freshly-fed human half burbles milk and flops around limply. \n\nHorse mothers lick the caul off newborns, which helps stimulate them into ‚Äúwake the fuck up, you‚Äôre officially alive now dumbass‚Äù mode. Picture that with humans. \n\nHorses randomly get non-horny erections sometimes, just like humans. The difference is there‚Äôs not any hiding when that happens for the centaur. \n\nFour extra nipples, quadruple the mastitis! No massaging that out with applied heat though, there‚Äôs not gonna be any reaching that udder themselves. Which brings us to‚Ä¶\n\nKnow the question of how a centaur wipes its ass? Well, the likely answer is ‚Äúwith help‚Äù. Centaurs are social creatures in the original myths, and humans for most of history used communal ass-wiping like a public ass sponge-on-a-stick and were still using corncobs or cloth that got washed and reused until the 1800‚Äôs. So the most likely answer is: before bidets, you got a buddy to do it. How do you get the ragdoll newborn to suckle the udder? Friend or hubby does it. Brambles in the coat? Centaurs picking thorns out of each other like monkeys picking each other‚Äôs fleas. Anything but centaurs living in a technological society with modern conveniences will require someone to take care of their grooming, so if your fantasy adventuring party has only one centaur then someone is stuck wiping the cleric‚Äôs ass and giving him nightly brushies.\n\nHorses also really like music. A rider who‚Äôs worried about them getting spooked could sing or whistle to keep them calm, sometimes lost horses would just wander into camps of people singing due to boredom. So, that joke about the Bard seducing monsterfolk? Yeah, that‚Äôs gonna be Super Effective on the centaurs. May as well put the Bard on centaur cleaning duty.\n\nEdit: added detail thanks to vintagebutterfly_, baby horse hooves are soft and come covered in a [gooey yellow coating.](https://www.petmd.com/horse/all-about-baby-horse-hooves) So baby centaurs are basically born in organic socks to protect the mother, which means their human half might also have flesh-mittens that will fall off later.']",-0.0044144144144144,,1,23,-0.3,6,30,5,12,2023,TIHI-18u8tmx.jpeg,3

It is also one of the most abundant carnivores in Africa.  \n  \nWhile most mongoose species are solitary, dwarf mongooses live in family packs of between 8 and 30 individuals.  \n  \nEach mongoose pack has one dominant pair, who are usually also the oldest of the group. While the male acts as a lookout, the female leads the pack. The dominant pair are also the only breeding pair in a pack.  \n  \nApart from the dominant pair, the hierarchy of a mongoose pack is determined by age ‚Äî in this case, the younger mongooses outrank their elders.  \n  \nThe dwarf mongoose falls prey to many predators; snakes, monitor lizards, marabou storks, raptors, jackals, and other mongooses.  \n  \nMongoose packs work together with hornbills ‚Äî specifically of the eastern yellow-billed and Von der Decken's variety ‚Äî while foraging. The mongooses flush out insects for the hornbills as they forage, while the hornbills keep keen watch of the skies for aerial predators.  \n  \nIn the morning, hornbills arrive at a dwarf mongoose mound to wake up the pack with clucking alarm calls. If no hornbills arrive, a mongoose pack may choose not to go foraging that day.\n\n**If you want, you can read more about the common dwarf mongoose and its relationship with hornbills (with more photos and details) on** [**my website here!**](https://www.curiousspecies.com/my-species/blog-post-title-one-yemxk-m29ek-dhngg-w852d-pr2mn-rx3pm-gm2rj-acerw-wca8h-j9yl6-3hf5w-wypyl-8jlcn-8y34a-we9ft-9mgen-9a7hw-yg4t5-4n388-xy7k3-p7ksp-ast43)"", ""**Sources:**\n\n[San Diego Zoo](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/dwarf-mongoose)\n\n[Animal Diversity Web](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Helogale_parvula/)\n\n[Chester Zoo](https://www.chesterzoo.org/our-zoo/animals/dwarf-mongoose/)\n\n[African Wildlife Foundation](https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/dwarf-mongoose)\n\n[Smithsonian's National Zoo](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/dwarf-mongoose)\n\n[Saint Louis Zoo](https://stlzoo.org/animals/mammals/carnivores/dwarf-mongoose)\n\n[Oregon Zoo](https://www.oregonzoo.org/animals/dwarf-mongoose)\n\n[Kruger National Park - Siyanona Africa](https://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_dwarf_mongoose.html)\n\n[Africa Geographic](https://africageographic.com/stories/dwarf-mongoose/)\n\n[Matira Safari](https://matirasafari.com/ungleiche-partner/?lang=en)\n\n[Lincoln Park Zoo](https://www.lpzoo.org/animals/dwarf-mongoose/)\n\n[IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/41609/45206516)\n\n[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41906-Helogale-parvula)\n\n[Dwarf Mongoose and Hornbill Mutualism in the Taru Desert, Kenya by O.

He discovered several vulnerabilities, which made the leak much easier than expected.\n\nOne of them was an AXFR vulnerability. DNS servers store IP addresses, so they can tell your browser how to connect to servers like Reddit when you enter an URL like reddit.com. These servers back up their information on secondary DNS servers, and AXFR is the process of updating the information on those secondary servers. Gembe found out Valve's DNS servers are vulnerable to AXFR attacks, which means pretending your computer is a secondary DNS server so the main one will send over all of its information. By downloading this information, Gembe found a sub-domain that wasn't protected by a firewall, which is simply a tool that scans all incoming internet packets and drops things that look suspicious, like packets from unknown or unauthorized IP addresses or packets that look like attacks. And Valve's domain controller had an account whose password was very easy to crack. (at least I think this is what happened, I don't know too much about network security)\n\nWhen Gembe was inside the network, he spent some time poking around and reading their design documentation. In 2003, he finally found and stole Half-Life 2's source code. (though at this point in the development process, the game wasn't very fun even after he figured out how to make a playable build from the code) He shared them with at least one other person, who decided to publicly leak it on the internet. Valve and Gabe Newell quickly found out about the leak and asked the FBI and everyone on the old [halflife2.net](http://halflife2.net) forums to help with tracking down the leaker.\n\nThey found close to nothing until Gembe himself sent an email that kept himself anonymous, but he did include previously un-leaked information that proved that he was the leaker. In a different email (not sure whether this was before or after the confession), he asked Valve for a job. Valve decided to pretend to interview him and tape the phone call in order to gain as much information as possible on who he was and how he was able to break into the network, and they were able to convince him that they were just 2 senior managers who wanted to hire him.\n\nJust a few days later, Gembe was arrested. He was very honest with the police and did not demand a lawyer. The police released him on proviso for 3 years while waiting for his trial. In this time, Half-Life 2 was officially released (specifically on 2004 November 16), and Gembe was able to start a security and administration job. He was sentenced to only 2 years of probation. Edit: Gembe was also arrested for a few other crimes, he likely would have gotten an even lighter sentence if the leak was the only thing he did.\n\nAccording to my sources, the leak was mostly motivated by curiosity and never intended to harm Valve or its employees. Gembe regrets causing so much trouble and not doing something better with his time, and he's still a big fan of Half-Life and Gabe Newell.\n\nAs of 2024, Gembe has a Reddit account and occasionally comments on programming-related or cat-related posts. The [halflife2.net](http://halflife2.net) domain name has also been bought out by an online poker site for some reason.\n\nVideo game history is the only history I know.\n\nsources:\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20050206144349/http://halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=10692](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206144349/http://halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=10692)\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/)\n\n[https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Half-Life\\_2\\_leak](https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Half-Life_2_leak)\n\n[https://www.briskinfosec.com/blogs/blogsdetail/DNS-Zone-Transfer](https://www.briskinfosec.com/blogs/blogsdetail/DNS-Zone-Transfer)"", ""Can't believe Half-Life 2 is 20 years old and still has an active modding community on both games."", '10/10 counter espionage.

What unknown critters clung to the bark of towering trunks? What oddities slithered, howled, and flew through the thick canopies? What beasts trampled along the gloomy rainforest floor? To an extent, it's still a place of mystery to this day, albeit the undiscovered creatures are of smaller stature ‚Äî largely invertebrates of the insect kind or the occasional small amphibian or reptile. The unknown has largely become known. But there are still creatures that skulk in the shadows of night and hide in the thick foliage, away from curious human eyes.  \n  \nThe Andes Mountain range is one of the longest in the world.¬π It slices its way along the western edge of South America, from Venezuela in the north to the southernmost tip of the continent in Chile. The valleys and foothills of these mountains vary greatly in climate; from the wet and green Yungas of Peru and Bolivia to the Atacama Desert of northern Chile ‚Äî the driest non-polar desert on Earth. Among the forested slopes that stretch from Colombia to Bolivia lives a little-known and seldom-seen creature. It cannot be called a jungle monster, for its temperament is known to be tranquil and uncombative. It is a peaceful creature in a world of danger and hostility.   \n  \nThe pacarana is stocky and thick-bodied ‚Äî some may call it chunky. Its portly mass is covered in a short but dense coat of grey-black fur, dotted and lined with white patches. It carries itself on four impressively clawed feet. Its snout is broad and blunt. Its eyes and ears are small, and a large nose, sprouting copious white whiskers, dominates its face. From the end of its snout to the tip of its thickly-furred tail, the pacarana can measure almost a metre (3.3 ft) long and weighs up to 15 kg (33 lbs). You may not be inclined to call it a large creature ‚Äî it does live in a land of hefty tapirs and sizable jaguars ‚Äî but it is a mammoth among its own kind.   \n  \nThis gentle giant is actually a rodent, one of over 2,000 living species. **Of those thousands, the pacarana is considered to be the third largest in the world.¬≤** It may not much resemble your typical rat or mouse, but it does share a close resemblance to one of its closest living relatives; the much more famous (and famously friendly) title holder for the world's largest living rodent, the capybara. A neighbouring resident of the South American rainforest, usually living near bodies of water, the capybara can weigh upwards of 79 kg (174 lbs). That makes it the world's largest rodent today, but it was not always so. **The pacarana that still lives nowadays would have been a dwarf some tens of thousands of years ago, living in the shadow of its colossal cousin, Josephoartigasia monesi ‚Äî the giant pacarana ‚Äî the largest known rodent to ever live. Described from fossils in Uruguay, this prehistoric giant is estimated to have weighed one tonne (2,200 lbs)**. It lived 5.3 million years ago and likely went extinct at the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago.  \n  \nWhile the capybara took a decidedly aquatic route in its evolution, the pacarana remains more terrestrial. But whether it prefers the world of the subterranean or the arboreal is undetermined. **The four long claws on each of its feet could be tools for climbing or digging. Perhaps it does both. It has been observed to skillfully climb trees, but its anatomy, including its claws, seems more suited to that of a burrower. However, it has not been known to dig in captivity, so the question remains**. Regardless, it's believed to spend most of its time slowly ambling along the forest floor in search of fruits, leaves and plant stems. **The pacarana's dining etiquette is quite refined for a giant rodent; it sits back on its haunches, then carefully manipulates and eats its food with its tactile forepaws ‚Äî appearing a bit like a sluggish oversized squirrel**."", 'This is why you stay out of the Fire Swamp.', 'Heyyyyy pacarana', '**Sources:**\n\n[Animal Diversity Web](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Dinomys_branickii/)\n\n[Animal Diversity Web](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Dinomyidae/)\n\n[Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/animal/pacarana)\n\n[Tambopata Ecolodge](https://www.tambopatalodge.com/en/jungle-blog/pacarana-one-of-the-strangest-animals-it-is-possible-to-see-in-the-western-amazon)\n\n[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/43837-Dinomys-branickii)\n\n[IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/6608/22199194)\n\n  \n[San Diego Zoo](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/capybara) - Capybara\n\n[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/02/04/giant-rats-to-inherit-the-earth/?sh=4e7a1e884657)\n\n[Prehistoric Fauna](https://prehistoric-fauna.com/Josephoartigasia-monesi)', 'This is clearly a baby wombat-hog.']",0.0380618013826969,,0,285,0.0666666666666666,14,27,0,5,2024,Awwducational-1d1scgm.jpeg,5

The problem is that the surface pressure of the air will push the epoxy down. What you can do is remove the surface pressure with a vaccum, that way you shouldn't get the U-shaped edges, which appear when the air press down on the epoxy and up the sides of your mold/container. The only other alternative to a vaccum is overflowing the mold. Both require a level surface, of course.\n\nIf you want to tool it.. then what you would need is a planer. You would need to make a negative of your emblem, that is relative level, and then put both of them through a planer. Or some DIY contraption many youtube videos advertise on how you can make your own planer. You would take one of the emblems you already have level and put them into the negative, then plane the negative to be flat/level... after which you can use the negative bottom down and plane the back of the emblem.\n\nBased on the picture i am assuming you have no jig to hold the emblem steady against the belt, which is why you get the variation. No matter how precise you are, you are still human and will not be able to guarantee equal distance at all time. You can go with a less aggressive belt. Like 400 grid and go slow.. that will allow you to reduce human error, or you will need some jig that ensures the Emblem is always touching the belt at the same distance.""]",0.0019965277777777,,0,29,0.0,3,29,6,9,2024,ResinCasting-1frvw0t.jpeg,0

And does the geometric fractal-like structure allow for better resolution/what benefits does it have over other structures? What kind of signal does this produce? Are there specialized algorithms for denoising and resolving a better image? How does this differ from traditional Radar antennas?  Radar wavelengths are really big compared to the size of a typical PCB, I assume this is just a prototype.

It's a cold, dry, windy, wild and beautiful place. In winter the sun never rises, and in summer it never sets. February the sky is a brilliant shade of blue with orange golden borders in the horizon.  the aurora borealis is common, but weaker than further south towards the mainland. It's nothing but fjords, mountains and valleys in every direction you travel or look. All white and desolate during the long winter, brown and noisy with geese in summer. There are 2 settlements, Longyear and the Russian town Barentsburg. The town rests at the bottom of a glacier in a valley surrounded by snowy peaks. Reindeer and ptarmigans are everywhere. You will see reindeer wandering through the streets in the city centre at night. There are almost no tweeting birds until spring arrives. There are no insects most of the year. Except for the humans, it's very quiet place most of the year.\n\nLongyear is a small town with a shop, a corner store, some cafes and a lot of adventure gear shops. There's a school, gym and swimming pool with sauna. There is a roadnetwork from the airport and through town making car travel possible but all other travel is by snowmobile, skis or foot. South of town is a sloped glacier, to the north is the icy beach and fjord. Eastwards is a river valley, to the west is the airport and another valley.\n\nYou need to be armed when you leave the town, not doing so is illegal. You should carry a rifle or side arm and flare. And while traversing the terrain you should always mind the conditions and stay wary of polar bears. It's a dangerous place, and theres a hundred ways to die on your daily hike to an ice cave or snowy peak. Avalanches, polar bears, hypothermia and blizzards are a constant threat outside of town.\n\nI found it both incredible and boring at the same time. The white outs, where wind and snow made doing anything outside impossible, were annoying. Constantly taking on and off massive layers of clothes as you go by your daily life gets tiring. And my asthma and dislike for winter sports made me spend less time outside than would have liked. Still, it was an incredible and unique experience I wouldn't be without. Imagine going for a walk a calm winter day and seeing reindeer, ptarmigans, beluga whales and a polar fox all on the same trip. I even got to dance to drum&bass drunk as hell on a party  boat going along the icy coast towards Barentsburg as minke whales were jumping around us."", 'Like Anctartica but with Polar Bears instead of Penguins.', 'She shows how it is: https://youtube.com/@ceciliablomdahl?si=rWZJOPgn4UPIJiX0\n\nGranted, from a content creator perspective and not a regular worker.', ""I saw a video, and it seems like a unique experience. \n\nInteresting people coming from all around the world peacefully live in harmony. \n\nThe crime rate is low.

That's easy to store records. Inside a building abandoned decades ago, it still looks like they left there a few days before. \n\nThe biggest problem, however, is the polar bear attacks; you cannot leave the settlement borders alone without a rifle.

So you end up needing to work backwards from the masu form to explain all the other forms. I disagree with the approach but if your class is doing it this way, then I guess you'll have to soldier on with it."", 'I will never understand why people teach -masu form before plain form. It never does anything but cause confusion later on. Simple and basic grammar comprehension will always be far more important than politeness, at least initially.', 'This is a weird chart, where did you get it?\n\nYou may not be able to get a good answer because studying the verbs like this is very unusual; most people do them from the plain/dictionary forms rather than the -masu forms like this, so it\'s hard to think of what other ""exceptions"" there might be.', 'I\'ve never seen this list or had any verbs considered ""exemptions"". The one thing you have to remember is Ichidan and Godan verbs. Ichidan (ending in -iru/eru only, but not all -iru/-eru are Ichidan) just lose the „Çã and get „Åæ„Åô at B2. Godano change the U into I, so „Åè -> „Åç, „Åô -> „Åó and so on.\n\nAn easy way to visualize verb bases is the order of the vowel. In Japanese the vowels are ordered „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä because that\'s the vowel Godan verbs for each base, in order. Verbs conjugated at:\nB1 (mizenkei) go „ÅÇ„ÄÅ„Åã„ÄÅ„Åï ...\nB2 (reny≈çkei, the connective form) become „ÅÑ„ÄÅ„Åç„ÄÅ„Åó...\nB3 and B4 (sh≈´shikei and rentaikei, respectively the ""dictionary"" and attributive forms) go „ÅÜ„ÄÅ„Åè„ÄÅ„Åô...\nB5 (izenkei but also works for katekei, hypothesis) go „Åà‚Ä¶\nB6 (meireikei, orders) go „Åä„Éª„Åä„ÅÜ\n\nFor Ichidan verbs it\'s easier because you just take off „Çã and you have one single base (hence Ichidan) good for everything']",-0.024015873015873,,0,121,0.0625,19,29,4,11,2024,LearnJapanese-1h2t708.jpeg,1

As far as I am concerned, the viscosity just continues to decrease as the salt concentration increases.\n\nIn many cases, the polymer will precipitate at high salt concentrations.\n\nI have no idea what ""the swallowing effect"" is. Can you explain?\n\nAlso where does this diagram come from? I\'d be interested to understand what the author is talking about. Maybe I missed something.\n\nEdit: I have missed [this paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/fd/d3fd00043e) from 2023, which reviews what it is all about. They call it ""underscreening"" and it only seems to occur when the concentrated ***electrolyte solutions*** squeezed. There is nothing about this exotic effect applying to solutions of charged polymers.', 'Yes, it is true! It is called the polyelectrolyte effect and is related to the 3D coil configuration of polyelectrolytes in solution. The added salt changes the configuration from a more elongated, swollen, state to a more coiled state, due to the salt screening charges. The charges in the polyelectrolyte repel each others resulting in a more elongated swollen configuration of the  coil. Adding salt screens some of these the charges on the polyelectrolyte and it can adopt a more coiled configuration.\n\nThe viscosity decreases as the number of entanglements between the polyelectrolyte chains decreases when the polyelectrolyte adopts a more coiled configuration. \n\nAt some point there are enough ions associated to the polyelectrolyte that the charges/ion start to repel again and the polyelectrolyte adopts  more elongated swollen configuration and the number of entanglements increase again and the viscosity increases again. However, the viscosity does not reach the same level as it was before salt was added.\n\nFor polyzwitterions, the opposite behaviour is observed, i.e the anti polyelectrolyte effect.\n\nNeutral polymer will precipitate out from solution when enough salt is added. Salt disturbes the hydrogen bonds solubilizing the polymer. Especially the cage of arranged water molecules surrounding the hydrophobic parts of the polymer. Once this cage breaks the hydrophobic parts will start to associate and the polymer precipitates.', 'If you want help understanding a graphic from a paper, typically it helps to link the paper...']",0.1229960317460317,,0,33,0.0,16,28,3,11,2024,chemistry-1h1zij0.jpeg,1

Underneath that topsoil, was mostly clay, which is red. Red soil was rarer in eastern Oklahoma, but common in western Oklahoma, which was drier and arid. As settlers moved west, they found that the wet forests turned into drier grasslands, and believed that these grasslands were unsuitable for farming. (which was true at the time)\n\nOf these western states, Oklahoma was the driest, and closest to most Native American tribes that were still in the East. It was labeled as undesirable land, and was marked as Indian territory and Native Americans were forced to move there. Settlers moved into the previously Native lands, which were the last ‚Äúunclaimed‚Äù wet, warm forested areas, and began farming there.\n\nAs farming technology advanced and the Civil War ended, it became possible to farm in the west, and so the wetter parts of Kansas and Nebraska were settled. Oklahoma was not spared, and the eastern parts were given away to settlers moving into the land. Oil was later discovered, which encouraged even more people to move in.\n\nThese settlers farmed the same way they did in the East, which didn't work due to the flat land and winds. The topsoil was loosened and blown around, and when a large drought hit, it was completely removed. The Oklahoma Panhandle, which was already arid, suffered the worst of it. Many people left, having lost everything, and many never returned.\n\nActions like the Shelter belt Project and sustainable farming helped the topsoil recover, and farmers returned. But still, they took a long time to recover economically, and some places, like the Panhandle, never fully recovered. The affected states will never be the same as they were before the dust bowl. Healthy topsoil takes hundreds of years to grow, so synthetic fertilizers and special farming practices make up for the lack of topsoil. Up north in the Dakotas, you can find lots of dark soil, and lots of farming is done without the need for extensive fertilizers. That's what Oklahoma probably looked like."", 'The red clay soil was already there and not seen as suitable for intensive agriculture. The name ""Oklahoma"" refers to this red clay soil, prominent in central Oklahoma. Oklahoma was made ""Indian territory"" and a state long before the dust bowl. This picture is likely of eastern ""Green Country"" Oklahoma and not terribly near the epicenter of the dust bowl. It is similar to other southeastern upland forest areas of the US. \n\nThe area hardest hit by the dust bowl centered on the panhandle in western Oklahoma, and the hardest hit areas spanned across several states including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, and Colorado. The current landscape is still semi-arid high plains, but intensive agriculture never returned to the region resembling the way it was before.

Hence why Luminara maintains that she hadn\'t given up on trying to save the two, she had simply already accepted the fact that it might be her padawan\'s time to become one with the force. Anakin could never empathise with this mindset after the loss of his mother, hence why Yoda\'s advice later in ROTS rang hollow. And the fact that Jedi seemingly do have Anakin\'s perception of what an ""attachment"" is feeds into his view that the Jedi are hypocrites.\n\nMind you, the series never paints either side as correct in this scenario, since it is likely that Anakin\'s tenacity and refusal to accept Ahsoka died is the reason her and Barriss survived at all. And ultimately, attachment is what saves the galaxy at the end of the day, since Vader\'s love for his son and refusal to let him die is what brings him back to the light, after having brought about his fall in the first place.']",-0.0239898989898989,,1,10,0.0,18,26,5,10,2024,PrequelMemes-1gcr75d.png,3

I suggest a product like this:  https://www.lowes.com/pd/Big-Stretch-10-5-fl-oz-White-Paintable-Latex-Caulk/4411173\n\nIt is paintable and flexible. Should make those cracks invisible to the casual eye.', 'Unfortunately there really isn‚Äôt a way to permanently fix drywall cracks, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they will resurface quickly. The frame of your house is made of wood and thus has a little bit of give as the temperature and humidity changes. Depending on where you live and the weather conditions, your house may also be settling.  \n\nWe had a massive slab leak and didn‚Äôt notice until our front lawn was completely saturated. We had it repaired but over the course of the next couple years that side of the foundation sank into the ground by about 1/8th of an inch. Not a whole lot, but it was enough for cracks to form around the corners of doors and windows.', ""Cracks at the corners of openings (windows, doorframes, archways, etc.) are often due to foundation movement. Another telltale sign is doors and windows beginning to rub/stick that did not do so before.\n\n\nIf your home is brand new, a little bit of cracking like this is normal and it's not overly concerning. Just tape and mub the seams and they should go away with time. Paintable latex caulk is another good option for particularly stubborn cracks (allows for more movement).\n\n\nIf your home is not new, you should do some additional integrative work to try and find the root cause. Does your foundation have any new cracks? Have existing cracks shifted or widened? Do your gutters work well? Is grading and drainage on your property adequate to keep water away from your home? Etc."", ""This is a settling issue. You may notice it expand and contract seasonally, if it's not still moving. But if it only keeps expanding, you have foundation issues to deal with.\n\nFurther investigation required."", 'I would leave it like it,  monitor it, and if it gets worse, it could indicate foundation problems']",-0.0641804735668372,,0,23,0.1,21,1,6,12,2024,DIY-1h4eadn.jpeg,0

BUT, I really think more actual pictures should be shown instead of always relying on these crude graphics.  \nOne of the big issues is that a lot of the structures in that image are drawn based off TEM images which are taken of extremely thin slices of cells, not the whole thing. This doesn\'t give you a good idea of what any individual organelle looks like in 3d, you\'re only seeing a tiny slice of it. Compare TEM images, to ones generated with fluorescently tagged proteins. HUGE difference. Mitochondria are very rarely that shape and are actually very long thin worm looking things that can also branch pretty dramatically and break apart and reconnect. The endoplasmic reticulum is thin tubes and spans the majority of the cell while being in a constant state of change and flux, not looking the same minute to minute. There also isn\'t a clear smooth/rough transition and they aren\'t really distinct persay. The golgi, is kinda like that honestly, but more tubey/bloby. The nucleus doesn\'t always look round, sometimes it\'s weirdly shaped, and sometimes cells have more than 1. Muscle for example is known to be heavily multi nucleated.   \nNothing is neat and round, everything is moving and constantly in flux, and cells themselves are usually long and thin and pointy, though that morphology changes dramatically based on exactly how they\'re growing, what cell type/tissue you\'re looking at. Cells come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.   \nPick any organelle, then look up that organelle with the words ""fluorescent super resolution"" after on google and you\'ll find amazing pictures of what they really look like. And if you look for videos you\'ll see their dynamics as they all move around.

They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.‚Äù\n\n>This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free.\n\n>The Declaration of the French Revolution made in 1791 on the Rights of Man and the Citizen also states: ‚ÄúAll men are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights.‚Äù\n\n>Those are undeniable truths.\n\n>Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice.\n\n>In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty.\n\n>They have enforced inhuman laws; they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North, the Center and the South of Vietnam in order to wreck our national unity and prevent our people from being united.\n\n>They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood.\n\n>They have fettered public opinion; they have practiced obscurantism against our people.\n\n>To weaken our race they have forced us to use opium and alcohol.\n\n>In the field of economics, they have fleeced us to the backbone, impoverished our people, and devastated our land.\n\n>They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials. They have monopolized the issuing of bank-notes and the export trade.\n\n>They have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of extreme poverty.\n\n>They have hampered the prospering of our national bourgeoisie; they have mercilessly exploited our workers.\n\n>In the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese Fascists violated Indochina‚Äôs territory to establish new bases in their fight against the Allies, the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country to them.\n\n>Thus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese. Their sufferings and miseries increased. The result was that from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, from Quang Tri province to the North of Vietnam, more than two million of our fellow-citizens died from starvation. On March 9, the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either fled or surrendered showing that not only were they incapable of ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù us, but that, in the span of five years, they had twice sold our country to the Japanese.\n\n>On several occasions before March 9, the Vietminh League urged the French to ally themselves with it against the Japanese. Instead of agreeing to this proposal, the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities against the Vietminh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners detained at Yen Bay and Caobang.\n\n>Notwithstanding all this, our fellow-citizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane attitude. Even after the Japanese putsch of March 1945, the Vietminh League helped many Frenchmen to cross the frontier, rescued some of them from Japanese jails, and protected French lives and property.\n\n>From the autumn of 1940, our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese possession.\n\n>After the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies, our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and to found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\n\n>The truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French.\n\n>The French have fled, the Japanese have capitulated, Emperor Bao Dai has abdicated. Our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland.

It wasn‚Äôt the word he usually used for it, but Ahsoka was only a kid, and Rex had decided from the start that talking about that sort of thing was something best left to her Jedi Masters. Yes, General Skywalker, I think that‚Äôs a job for you, sir. It wasn‚Äôt a clone‚Äôs duty at all.\n\n>‚ÄúRomance,‚Äù Ahsoka said stiffly, ‚Äúis acceptable. Jedi are not ‚Ä¶ celibate. Just ‚Ä¶ no attachment.‚Äù\n\n>Ince adopted a wonderful frown of apparent bewilderment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit cold, ma‚Äôam.

Rex debated whether to stop the baiting or see where it was going. These were kids, all of them. If Ahsoka wanted to command‚Äîand she did, it was clear‚Äîthen she had to learn that young officers got a rough ride. His young clones, regardless of the constant training that told them Jedi were invincible and omniscient, saw her as a novice like them, projecting no real authority.\n\n>I don‚Äôt remember being like that. I‚Äôm maybe a year older than them, if that.\n\n>And it‚Äôs only months since Geonosis, not even a year. It feels like a lifetime ago.\n\n>Ahsoka let go of her fierce defensive grip around her legs and sat up straight, boots on the floor.\n\n>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make the rules,‚Äù she said at last. Her voice was very different; there was a faint, rasping undertone, like the echo of a sand panther‚Äôs growl, and Rex was reminded yet again that the Togrutas‚Äô primal ancestors were predators. ‚ÄúBut I accept that wiser beings made them, and so I‚Äôll follow them.‚Äù\n\n>‚ÄúWe follow orders, too,‚Äù Hil said. ‚ÄúWe understand. Except we can usually see what goes wrong when we don‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\n>‚ÄúYeah, you get hurt,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúOr worse.‚Äù\n\n>‚ÄúI have to deal in the unseen,‚Äù Ahsoka said quietly.\nCoric looked as if he was going to say something, and then thought better of it. He went back to his datapad. Rex decided the maneuvering was over and that Ahsoka had at least maintained her dignity.\n\nAnd this from **Master & Apprentice** which is Canon.\n\n>Once Selbie had stalked out with her head held high, Averross had no further excuse to avoid eye contact with Qui-Gon. The man‚Äôs face was as inscrutable as ever, but the moment the door swung shut behind Selbie, Qui-Gon said, ‚ÄúHave you forgotten yourself entirely?‚Äù\n\n>Averross laughed. ‚ÄúOh, please. Like you didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù\n\n>‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about what happened in my past,‚Äù Qui-Gon said.\n\n>‚ÄúOh, no? Guess it‚Äôs about hypocrisy, then.‚Äù\n\n>‚ÄúThere is a difference,‚Äù Qui-Gon insisted, righteous as ever, ‚Äúbetween falling in love and simply giving oneself license to do as one pleases.‚Äù\n\n>**‚ÄúYeah, there is.‚Äù Damn, but Averross wished he had that ale around now. ‚ÄúFalling in love‚Äîthat‚Äôs what the Jedi Code forbids. Getting laid? Not so much, not if it‚Äôs casual, like me and Selbie.

Because in a total anarchy, nothing prevents you from stealing someone elses resources. So private property rights are not guaranteed.\n\nMy argument is that, states serve a purpose. They will and should exist. They serve the purpose to protect its inhabitants, and their property. If the citizen has nowhere else to go, and has to settle with its state, then this is akin to slavery.\n\nWhat I propose is a totally decentralized country, in which people can choose their own state, or state-like structures to live in, or pure anarchy. A country where creating and destroying a state is really easy. Borrowing from French revolutionary discussions, I say that only thing legitimizes the existence of a state is a social contract. They mean it in an abstract way. But I mean in a real, tangible way.\n\nAll states can be mere computer code, signed and thus legitimized by its citizens, who can switch their allegiance easily. Just like any contract between an employer and employee is sacred, so it should be between a state and its citizen, if there is an consensual agreement.\n\nWe can implement social contracts with distributed ledger technologies. There are some fundamental steps that needs to be taken to create states that live in a decentralized consensus protocol. There needs to be significant advancements in AI and cryptography, in order to achieve that. But it is not impossible.\n\nI created a post about this if you are interested:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1d6cm8d/a\\_futuristic\\_utopia\\_which\\_is\\_governed\\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1d6cm8d/a_futuristic_utopia_which_is_governed_by/)"", 'I don\'t think that it is particularly important what exact type or form of government you care to have as long as it responsive to the needs and desires of the people living under it. \n\nSo the government needs to be structured in a way to make that happen.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRule #1: \n\nOne of the important aspects is that it needs to be physically small and limited in terms of numbers of people involved.  Like it should be illegal for any single government to collect taxation from more then a couple million people or something like that.\n\nThe rise of the administrative state and total take over by bureaucracies is the bane of modern existence. \n\nCapitalism, by definition, is the private ownership of capital.  However modern large public corporations are not controlled or really owned by anybody.  The decision making is done by c-level executives who are nothing more then caretaker bureaucrats. These are the ones that call the shots.  Individual share holders technically have ""ownership"", but unless they are one of the few ""Whales"" that control seats on the board of directors their ownership of the stock confers no actual ownership benefits or controls.  \n\nIf I was to buy Apple stock, for example, I can\'t then just run down to Apple HQ and demand to be let in.  I will get arrested for trespassing if I persist to make myself a annoyance. \n\nAnd that is what is going on at all levels in Western civilization.  Ownership, private property rights, is becoming increasingly meaningless.  Instead what is happening is that all major decisions and policies are set by a special Mandarin Class, or a Professional-Managerial Caste System made up of Party Insiders and greater party membership of outsiders. \n\nIt isn\'t capitalism.  It is a fucked up and mutated form of [corporatism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/corporatism).  Capitalism only really exists in terms of small and medium privately owned business.. with a few exceptions. (it is complicated)\n\n\nSome bureaucracy is necessary.  It is critical to maintaining any sort of cohesive organization.  You needs rules and procedures and ways to manage expectations between different people in any organization.  But economy of scale is a double edged sword and bureaucracies scale miserably. \n\nFor small organizations the bureaucracy is almost a informal afterthought.  It is often limited to just reminding people to carry out different tasks and the total time and expense on that is a tiny fraction of a small organization\'s budget.\n\nBut once you get past a few thousand people you run into the bulk of the resources a organization consumes goes to just maintaining itself.  Big businesses may spend 70 or 80% of their budget to just paying salaries and offices of professional bureaucrats...  HR people, IT people, Programmers, Accountants, Customer service reps, office space, computers, air conditioning, trainers, managers, directors, c-level execs, physical security, etc.    of the people hired actually provide services or produce goods or do useful work like use fork lifts to load up trucks for shipping.  And they are usually the least expensive. \n\nFor something like the Federal government you have, very literally, millions of people who do nothing but  work constantly day in and day out to maintain organization cohesion.  Even the police are really nothing more then bureaucrats. \n\nSo to avoid that issue and issues with voting and so on and so forth... the organization of government musts be physically small. \n\n---------------------------------------\n\nRule #2:\n\nThere must be rival political organizations.  No centralized sovereign authority. \n\nSo for a city-state situation you can have, say,  home owners association, business league, town council, and churches. Along with privately owned courts and separate privately owned security.  Just saying this is a possible model, not the ideal one.  \n\nThe idea is then that each organization then represent a different aspect of ownership and way people participate in society. \n\nSo that if, say, the town council gets a big head and tries to do some corruptive shit people can go crying to the business league or church to slap them down and visa versa. \n\nThis way everything done that is bigger then a individual is always a negotiation and maximizes the ability of people to participate in the system to protect themselves and their rights.   \n\nThis way you don\'t have some grand poo-bah spending millions of your money on his cousin\'s road construction company and when you object to it the city council can go and tell you to get bent.']",0.0238239689271387,,0,90,0.3583333333333333,19,12,5,10,2024,libertarian-1g27r3w.jpeg,4

If wounded, a rockster can restore its health by nibbling on a gem, and many rocksters hoard precious stones for that reason.\n\n***Pact of the Chain Familiar.*** At the gamemaster‚Äôs discretion, a warlock with a pact of the chain may choose the form of a rockster for their familiar.\n\n**What do you think? :)**']",0.2099905303030303,,0,57,0.0,8,30,5,11,2024,Art-1h38f2l.jpeg,0

With no union employees lack the leverage to extract a bigger share from companies. The net result is the market determines the value of their labor, and the outcome is what we see here: people paid as little as humanly possible for their skillset.\n\nThe problem with letting the market determine the value of your labor is that in a globalized marketplace you're not just competing against people with the same rules and regulations. You're competing with people in places that have no labor or environmental laws at all, some of which can live on less than a dollar a day. Good luck making meaningful money in that kind of environment without a very valuable skillset."", 'Good try, maybe even pretty, but no, inflation is still the problem, easy, almost free money, that only those who already have have access to. All that greedy and all that wouldn‚Äôt exist without excess money.', 'TLDR: Granted CEOs are currently overcompensated, but not by as much as people think. They take on outsized burden of risk and usually the ‚Äúlions share‚Äù of their income is simply recognizing equity value they were paid years before, while taking a very light paycheck.\n\nI‚Äôd like to point out the income of CEOs is very little in terms of a paycheck. Some of the richest billionaires only have a yearly net paycheck of 5 to 6 figures. True, they sometimes get bonuses in the millions, but those usually require board approval.\n\nTheir real wealth comes from their stake and equity in the company. So CEO has technically not been ‚Äúpaid‚Äù more but rather is recognizing the investments they placed into their company from years prior. This is usually due to a vesting period, a time limit they cannot breach before ‚Äúcashing out‚Äù. Basically a promise that they‚Äôll stay and do their best to make the value of their stake in the company grow. But if a company is doing well, and is planning to make more profits, then the CEO may put off executing their options until the company is worth a lot more too, instead of cashing out right away Also, when a company is doing well under a CEO‚Äôs leadership, boards will often incentivize a CEO to stay on via more equity and stock options thus continuing the cycle.\n\nI‚Äôd also like to point out risk-to-reward stake at businesses. A common misconception is that CEOs derive all their value off the backs of their employees. This is false. CEOs have to make huge risks to get the product or services to the right customers and maintaining the right suppliers. This involves making multimillion dollar deals, that if go wrong usually means their ousting and could even be held personally responsible by the board. This could include lawsuits. This means no warnings, no second tries. This is not even to point out the personal investments they may have made into the company at early stages', 'Looking at you, Boeing.']",0.2263550616050616,,0,7,0.25,23,24,6,11,2024,economy-1gz4g04.jpeg,4

The blunt reality is that freer societies are wealthier societies and even working-class people in freer societies enjoy a higher material quality-of-life than the aristocracy of the ancient world.\n\nAnd no, the Nordic countries don\'t ""prove"" there\'s such a thing as ""good"" socialism. They too are market-based economies, differ from the US on matters of degree rather than principle, and their welfare states are mostly funded by regressive consumption taxes that impact the poor more than the rich, and often use market-based structures (for example, Sweden has school vouchers). \n\nThere is simply NO credible, material-wealth-oriented or lifting-up-the-minimum-standard-of-living-oriented case against capitalism. At best you can argue for a mostly-market-based mixed economy that concedes all the basic principles of a free society but makes narrowly-defined exceptions for exceptional situations. \n\nThat said, I am not entirely sure she\'s correct that the only thing capitalism needs is to be defended in principle from self-ownership grounds (even though I agree such a defense is legitimate and correct). I think part of the problem is not merely cultural, but evolutionary: the human lizard brain did not evolve to deal with complex modern economies, and instead seems to have zero-sum thinking encoded within it to some degree, as well as a preoccupation with *positional status* rather than objective improvements. This would explain why economics is often counterintuitive, that new economics students need to be deeply reprogrammed to get all the fallacious thinking out of their brains (as Bryan Caplan talked about), and why collectivism can kill hundreds of millions yet still persist and even be thought highly of.\n\nI think one of the reasons Rand focused so much on conscious ideas and neglected unconscious biases was projection. Everyone has biases, her included, but she clearly was much less vulnerable to the-cognitive-biases-that-lead-to-fallacious-economic-thinking than the average person. Consequently, she thought it was a simple matter of shifting someone\'s ethical beliefs. If only she were right...\n\nI agree with her that culture and morality are pieces of the puzzle. But neurobiology, unfortunately, also plays a role, and makes it far harder to reform anticapitalist attitudes than libertarians would like.', ""Wasn't she on government assistance to stay alive as a senior citizen though?"", 'Can we stop using her she was hateful and had serious trouble with sexual consent', '[deleted]']",0.047282856032856,,0,77,0.25,18,9,2,10,2024,libertarian-1fzxu1d.jpeg,4

They hoped that this project would drain Qin's resources and weaken its ability to invade Han. However, this plan backfired. The canal system, instead of draining resources, increased the fertility of the soil and boosted agricultural productivity.

Not a tree, shrub, or any other object, either animate or inanimate, relieved the dreary monotony of the prospect...it is a region almost as vast and trackless as the ocean a land where no man, either savage or civilized, permanently abides; it spreads forth into a treeless, desolate waste of uninhabited solitude, which always has been, and must continue, uninhabited forever.‚Äù\n-‚ÄîCaptain Randolph Marcy, recording his first view of the Texas Panhandle, diary, 1849. It must have seemed an endless, daunting, impenetrable place to those who first saw it from horseback.', ""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llano_Estacado\n\nYour redline basically follows the Llano Estacado, although a bit to the east...this is likely due to the color of the erosion from the caprock in this transition zone.\n\nEdit:  I'll add that the average annual rainfall in Texas is a pure gradient east to west.  From Beaumont to about the Pecos River, every 50 miles or so that you go heading west the average annual rainfall drops by about 2-4 inches per year.  At about where you drew your line, there's a lot of deciduous hardwood trees that will stop growing naturally (think live oaks, Red oaks, and pecans) and you're left with mostly mesquite but otherwise grassland and some scrub brush."", 'Elevation really drops off around that region. Vegetation changes, weather patterns adjust slightly, soil changes as well. I think a lot of it has to do with that region most recently being under water‚Ä¶ 265* million years ago', ""There's a few. The 98th meridian is usually seen as the divide between East and West in the United States. It runs from the Dakotas down to Texas passing just West of Austin. Essentially, everything west of the 98th meridian doesn't receive enough rainfall to support agriculture (with the exception of irrigation). That's why the population density of the U.S is much higher east of it, and why the west is mostly desert. The line you drew runs from roughly the 98th to the 100th meridians west. Also, the Llano Estacado and the Edwards Plateau (which is essentially the area South of that Line) are bordering Tablelands/Mesa's that receive different levels of rainfall and runoff based on how far East/West they are and different altitudes."", ""It's where one ecoregion is fading into another.

There is clear evidence which stories were written first and which were a later adaptations. And the rest of the flood stories from around the world just happened to be from civilizations that used to flood occasionally and had a very different narrative.\nWe have living trees that date back over 9000 years. Not only does that predate the biblical estimate of the age of the Earth of 6000 years, it shows that the flood never happened approximately 4370 years ago as creationist websites claim.. How can a tree survive underwater for an entire year? \nNot to mention that major civilizations like the Egyptians and the Chinese were in existence before the suppose flood and yet amazingly enough were not affected by it nor mentioned it. \nWe have hundreds of thousands of anual ice core layer samples from Antarctica and Greenland that corroborate each other. These layers are analysed and dated using multiple scientific methods other than just counting layers. Even dendrochronology (the scientific method of dating tree rings to the exact year they were formed in order to analyze atmospheric conditions during different periods in history) is used to corroborate and calibrate the ice core layers up to 15,000 years. The analysis of the ice cores accurately show all major climate events throughout its history. It shows the last iceage approximately 11,000 years ago. It even shows the volcanic eruption of Pompeii back in 79AD. And it definitely shows no sign of a worldwide flood in the last 20,000 years.\nThere's also the problem of specialized diets of the animals. Take the Koalas from Australia. Lets disregard it's impossibility to get to the ark let alone a sloth from South America getting there. Evidence shows for the last 50,000 years koalas have lived on a strict diet of fresh eucalyptus leaves and will only eat fresh leaves off a branch. That's one major problem right there. A lot of animals need fresh specialized food, specialized climate and habitat to survive which is impossible on an ark for an entire year.\nAnother problem with the flood myth is the fossil record. It is not conceivable that a worldwide flood would bury (and instantly fossilize) all types of plants and animals in discrete layers everywhere in the world, in a pattern indicating descent with modification. Similarly, a global flood would not produce fossil tracks, animal burrows, leaf impressions and entire forests at various levels in the same geological column. If all plants and animals were created at the same time, then destroyed in a global flood, the resulting fossils (if any) would be randomly distributed. The geological distribution of animals world wide match where their evolutionary fossil records are found and not from an epicentre from Noah's Ark.\n\nWhile I'm here I may as well destroy the Bible entirely. \n\nWith Genetics, Mitochondrial DNA shows that the human population has never gone down below 3,000 individuals in the last 200,000 years, let alone a population of 8 which was Noah and his family approximately 4370 years ago. This fact also destroys the Adam and Eve fairytale. Without the Adam and Eve story, there would be no 'Original Sin'. Without original sin there will be no need for Jesus, the Christian religion falls apart completely.\n\nThe whole religion is based on and relies on a story that could not possibly be true. \nEND GAME.""]",-0.0183032514080901,,0,48,0.25,19,21,5,9,2024,terriblefacebookmemes-1fmak2s.png,3

Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you hold that opinion: what makes it good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?\n\n* Stay on-topic. We know that design can sometimes be political or controversial, but please keep comments focussed on the design itself, \nand the strengths/weaknesses thereof. \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A portfolio should not lead with ‚Äòlow cost‚Äô.\n\nWhy is the CTA ‚Äòcontact‚Äô? I would want to see your work before I contacted you, and better understand your offering. \n\nI would scrap those random line shapes and bring your main H1 up towards the top. I‚Äôd rework the ‚Äòlow cost‚Äô aspect but that‚Äôs your call. Then I would start showing some work/case studies right on the home page. Maybe just have a couple of your best ones with a CTA to see more under that.\n\nI might also suggest having chat GPT help you with your intro statement. You use the word ‚Äòmany‚Äô twice and there‚Äôs better adjectives and stronger ways to speak to what you mention. I would also bump that up in size. There‚Äôs too much contrast in type size between your headline and sub (top?) copy. Reverse the order of those.', 'Navbar needs more padding. The contact button is nearly kissing the top of the frame. The contact button paired with the ""And"" just makes it read weird. I would stick with the tried and true hierarchy of H1 > Body copy > CTA. The leading on the H1 needs to be tightened up. Hard to tell here, but the body copy seems to be too small in relation to everything else, I would probably set it at 16pt. You also need something poking out of the fold to indicate to the user that there is more content below (if you have more content below).', 'I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the second contact button in the headline, and I think that your headline would look better layered on top of the background image, higher up on the page.

""Get visually stunning websites at low cost"" makes me flag you more as a competitor rather than a potential employee - plus it makes me wonder what corners you might be cutting to make them low cost.\n\n\nI\'d probably aim for something a little more refined like, ""Stunning and effective websites built efficiently.""\xa0\n\n\nIf you\'re looking for freelance work, I reckon it\'s fine to keep as is but you\'re also going to attract a certain kind of clientele.\n\n\nEither way you also need to make your work more visible, or have the link to get there more prominent.

And the idea was that a Joint Resolution would terminate the emergency.  So President could unilaterally declare an emergency, Congress could suspend it.\n\nThen Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha in 1983 happened and SCOTUS ruled that Legislative veto was unconstitutional.  This would ruin the idea that Congress alone could undo a declaration of an emergency.\n\nEver since then, undoing emergency powers has been on the ""to-do list"" for Congress.  Why the 117th Congress did not move on this is beyond me as it\'s one of those things 10 Republican Senators would have easily joined onto as both Democrat and Republican President alike have used (or abused however you want to look at it) this power.\n\nThere has been identified [123 powers that the President can invoke with an emergency](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf) and there are an additional 13 powers available if Congress joins in.\n\nAll of them are amazing powers that allow all kinds of revoking rights of the public with little to no oversight.  And the fact that we\'ve just let this out there for this long really indicates the level of incompetence Congress has dealt with over the many decades that they have not FIXED this.\n\nSo yeah, this should have been fixed in the 80s and it hasn\'t.  And that the public isn\'t enraged that this legal way for the President to royally fuck us all still exists, I mean I don\'t know, maybe we\'re the ones to blame here.\n\nBut 50 USC chapter 34 should not be what it is.  The ability for the President to just continually renew an emergency over and over and over and over again to unilaterally suspend the rights of the people SHOULD NOT EXIST.  And that Congress has over the last four decades done NOTHING to fix this is just a monumental failure by all of them.\n\nIt\'s fucking terrifying that we still have this shit on our books.  But even worse that Congress just routinely fails to ever address this shit.', 'Republicans will abuse all loopholes and ignore the norm, while Democrats sit on their asses yelling ‚Äúthat‚Äôs illegal‚Äù and don‚Äôt do anything.\n\nAnything Trump tried can also be done by the incumbent right now too.', 'If they deported 20 million people, Americans would starve.', 'I think a lot of people are misunderstanding what is happening.

While Laotian communists were able to be on friendly terms with the Vietnamese for the most part, the Khmers have a difficult relations with Vietnam due to historical tensions (the southern lands of Vietnam used to be Khmer) and an inferiority complex, that Vietnam was the big brother who‚Äôs always telling them what to do. While Vietnam begins to align with the USSR, the Khmer Rouge were warming up to China.\n\n- When Sihanouk was couped by Lon Nol and the monarchy replaced by a republic/military dictatorship, war broke out, with Lon Nol inviting US forces in the country. Factors that contribute to the Khmer Rouge rise from a rag tag army (while Sihanouk was in power) to the eventual ruling government includes outrages against US bombings (which was also effective in keeping a communist victory at bay), Sihanouk calling upon his countrymen to join the Khmer Rouge (whom he allied with) and Vietnamese support (along with other communist countries) as they have interests.\n\n- When the war ended, Sihanouk was placed in house arrest, Pol Pot began his policies (read: murder) and the socialist brotherhood solidarity began to crack, giving way to geopolitical tensions with external powers (USSR and China) having a reason to support one or the other in Indochina, leading to open conflict again.\n\n- The Vietnamese intervention did have the effect of ending the genocide, and many Cambodians were thankful as there could be no worse alternative than Pol Pot, but they were also an occupying force and very soon, tensions arose, whether one‚Äôs Khmer Rouge or not.\n\nIt‚Äôs essential to know that blaming one external party or another (whether it‚Äôs US, Vietnam, China, etc) for the woes on Cambodia removes the agency and responsibilities of the Cambodians themselves, whom we tend to forget/cast aside (alongside other factors) in favor of big names for the blaming game.

1gud6em,3Dmodeling,Is Texel Density required to be used for every model you make?,10,0,10,0.75,CH3R03,2024-11-18 19:27:39,27,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dmodeling/comments/1gud6em/is_texel_density_required_to_be_used_for_every/,https://i.redd.it/odlbayviop1e1.jpeg,jpeg,2158x1308,362638,1258563,Creative,"[""You seem to be confused as to what texel density actually is. It's not something you use instead of something else, it's something that's inherent to texturing workflows.\n\nTexel density is a measurement that works off the physical size of your models and measures the resolution of your UV shells in relation to the size of your texture map.\n\nSo you have a rectangle which you plan on texturing with 2K (2048x2048)textures, let's say that you're working with centimeters and that the rectangle is 20cm long horizontally and 10cm long vertically. If you have a texel density of 30 per unit (unit = centimeter in this case), it means that every horizontal and every vertical centimeter of your model will be allocated 30 pixels of texture resolution. Since your rectangle is 20cm horizontally and 10cm vertically, that means that a total of 600 texture pixels will be allocated to it out of the 2048 available horizontal pixels and 300 of the total 2048 vertical pixels. If you update your textures and use 4K maps instead, the rectangle will now occupy the exact same physical dimensions inside your 0-1 UV space, but will now have 1200 horizontal and 600 vertical texture pixels since your texture map size went from 2048x2048 to 4096x4096 pixels. The same works in reverse, so a 1024x1024 map will have 300 horizontal and 150 vertical texture pixels.\n\nAs for determining the actual texel density you'll need, it depends on the use of your model and its distance from the camera. If it's for a first person game (so very close to the camera) you will need a higher texel density than a third person game. I think some usual baselines are 20.48 pixels per meter for first person and 10.24 pixels for third person, but that's just a rough guide. On the other hand, if your model is for a cinematic such as advertising or visual effects for films, you will need much higher numbers - and that's where UDIMs come into play because you will not be able to fit the necessary visual fidelity inside a single 4K texture.\n\nFor personal projects, go with the eye test. Pack all your UVs in a single tile, apply a preset smart material that has high frequency details (dirt, rust, repeating patterns etc), and render it out. If it looks low res, you could then split your UVs into more tiles.\n\nIt's likely that you'll read this comment and not make much sense of it, but that's fine. Just trust your eyes and keep practicing, and over time it will start making sense."", 'I want to start by saying a lot of your post doesnt make sense. You seem to be using the term ""texel density"" in some weird ways. Maybe read through the post one more time and see if you can explain what you are trying to say a little more clearly. You arent mentioning what texel density you are trying to achieve, or what makes you think you need to achieve that density.   \n  \nGiven the faceting on the model and the mention of unreal i assume this is a game model. Typically in games we dont use udims, but instead use multiple materials, one for each udim. That way they can all stay in the 0-1 and doesnt need special setup in engine.   \n\n\nThat said typically a pistol like this, especially just the frame of a pistol would use only one udim tile, not 4. So you seem to be creating an issue through trying to achieve massive resolution that you dont need.   \nYour uvs are also very poorly unwrapped and arranged. without pulling out my calipers i can easily see one side of the grip is bigger than the other. There are tons of thin curved shells that could be straightened, and shells that have been cut that dont need to be cut.', 'Seems you are confusing the term. Here you go \n\nhttps://www.beyondextent.com/deep-dives/deepdive-texeldensity', 'Before worrying about texel density, learn to unwrap better. Because with your current unwrap the pixels are going to be bigger on one side of the grip than the other no matter what resolution textures you use. Your UVs need to be correctly scaled in relation to each other.', 'I will add to this and say I want this to be all 2k throughout. Including the px/u (I am using Maya as my modelling Software) would I even need to worry about this and just press layout in the 1-1 square on a 2k map?

The Umlauts were represented in German by adding an e after one of the three vowels a, o and u. So ae, oe, and ue for √§, √∂ and √º. Same for the capital letters. the following e however would be lower case.\n\nBut how did we get to the two dots over the umlauts? The answer can be found within Kurrent, the old German script for handwriting. There e is represented by two small downstrokes. These were put above the vowels. In print however the more familiar form of e got used instead.\nThis process might have happened gradually. I've seen texts that used aÕ§, oÕ§ and uÕ§, but not the capital forms. There they still set the letters separately. If I remember correctly UÕ§ might have took the longest to implement. At least I've seen texts using the other umlauts but not this one. \n\nIn the Latin alphabet the strokes over the umlauts got stylized to dots. Which is the point we are at now.\nIn terms of printed Fraktur the strokes remained in many cases. You can also see those in calligraphy. Mind you many styles also use the diamond shape instead."", 'The one above (Latin) represents two distinct letters which are just visually fused together.

1g5rsbu,Awwducational,"To attract a mate, a male copper pheasant drums loudly with his wings and flaunts his tail feathers, which can be 125 cm (4.1 ft) long. But it's the female who does the parenting. She makes a nest on the ground and stays atop her eggs throughout the night, even when other birds shelter in the trees.",530,0,530,0.98,IdyllicSafeguard,2024-10-17 14:10:50,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Awwducational/comments/1g5rsbu/to_attract_a_mate_a_male_copper_pheasant_drums/,https://i.redd.it/j7l6nvzrqbvd1.jpeg,jpeg,1160x870,250741,5911900,Reactions,"['The copper pheasant is known as the *yamadori* (Â±±È≥•) in Japanese.  \n  \nThis pheasant is endemic to the Japanese Archipelago ‚Äî found on the main islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu ‚Äî where it lives in montane forests.  \n  \nWhile the female is an unflashy reddish-brown, the male is a deep copper, with feathers rimmed in white, and markings of crimson over each eye.  \n  \nBut the male\'s most extravagant trait is his luxuriant tail feathers; barred with nodes of black, white, and deep copper, and capable of growing to lengths of 125 cm (4.1 ft) long.  \n  \nAccording to folklore, if you find a male\'s tail feather with 13 nodes, it will repel evil spirits. It\'s also said that the feathers of older *yamadori* glow in the dark.  \n  \nDuring the copper pheasant\'s breeding season, from late winter to early spring, you\'ll hear the proud ""drumming"" of an advertising male echoing through the forest. The sound is created as he beats his wings rapidly and air rushes over his feather quills.   \n  \nThe folkloric version of this pheasant is a prankster that likes to frighten people. Its drumming creates a noise like startling explosions and the sound of severed heads rolling down the mountainside.   \n  \nAfter attracting a mate ‚Äî and sometimes fighting a rival male for one ‚Äî a male pheasant stays close to the female, guarding her possessively.   \n  \nThe male puts more effort into courting than parenting. The female is the one who creates a nest on the ground, lays the eggs, and incubates them.  \n  \nEven when other birds take shelter in the trees at night (to avoid nocturnal ground predators) the mother pheasant stays dutifully atop her nest on the forest floor.  \n  \nChicks hatch after about 24 days. They leave their nest only hours after hatching, proceeding to follow their mother around.   \n  \nIf you were to approach a mother pheasant with her chicks, the mother may either threaten you with a mock attack or fake an injury, attempting to distract you (a potential predator!) from her chicks.  \n  \nWhile this pheasant can fly, it\'s not very good at it. It usually chooses to escape danger on foot, charging uphill and into thick foliage. If it\'s taken by surprise, it may emit a ""kyukkyuk"" alarm call, while exploding from the bushes, wings whirring loudly, and then gliding off downhill.   \n  \nDue to its elusiveness and the male\'s stunning feathers, it is a much sought-after species for naturalists and birders.  \n  \nConsidered to be \'Near Threatened\' by the [IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22679340/92811551), this species has long been the target of hunters. More recently, it\'s been threatened by habitat destruction and replacement by large-scale tree plantations.  \n  \nIn areas of southern Japan, people say there was a time when they would see the copper pheasant more regularly ‚Äî on their walk to or from school, for example ‚Äî but after much planting of cultivated cedar in the 1970s, such sightings became scarce.  \n  \n**You can read more about the copper pheasant on** [my website here!](https://www.curiousspecies.com/my-species/es6hd5cxkheldm9-sz66x)', 'So‚Ä¶much like human males peacocking? üòÇüòÇ', '**Sources:**\n\n[Japan Bird Research Association](https://www.bird-research.jp/1_shiryo/seitai/yamadori.pdf)\n\n[eBird](https://ebird.org/species/copphe1)\n\n[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/1159-Syrmaticus-soemmerringii)\n\n[IUCN](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22679340/92811551)\n\n[Food habits of the copper pheasant Syrmaticus soemmerringii in winter season by Noritomo KAWAJI, et al.](https://www.ffpri.affrc.go.jp/thk/research/publication/ffpri/documents/411-2.pdf)\n\n[First observation of ground roosting of the Copper Pheasant by Noritomo Kawaji](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250277304_First_observation_of_ground_roosting_of_the_Copper_Pheasant)\n\n[BRAZIL, M.

Basically, this equation is the same as\n\nlimit h->0 [s(t+h) - s(t)] / h\n\nWhere s(t) represents our position function = 1/3 ‚Ä¢ t^2 and the derivative of s(t), which is s‚Äô(t), is equal to the instantaneous velocity at any point t -> v(t) = s‚Äô(t) = 2/3 ‚Ä¢ t\n\nUsually, to find the average velocity, we can take two points (initial and final position) and find the slope between the two-> (t initial, position initial) and (t final, position final) -> also known as (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)\n\nWhere average velocity = (x2-x1)/(y2-y1)\n\nHowever, instantaneous velocity, where we must measure at one point, says that the distance between final and initial position is 0 and the time elapsed would then be 0 but we can‚Äôt mathematically calculate that using the average velocity formula because x2=x1 and y2=y1 so average velocity = (0)/(0) would be undefined \n\nThus, limits allow us to build a function that creates any slope (of the tangent line) at any point on the graph. When we calculate limit as t->0 [Œîx/Œît], we‚Äôre actually just calculating the slope of of the secant lines as the distance between two points approaches 0 and when the distance is 0, the line intersects exactly 1 point (tangent line) in the graph rather than 2 (secant line), which is why we call limit as t->0 [Œîx/Œît] the slope of the tangent line to the positon function at any time t \n\nFurther proof of this:\n\nlimit h->0 [s(t+h) - s(t)] / h\n\nWhere \n\ns(t) = 1/3 ‚Ä¢ t^2\n\nThen \ns(t+h) = 1/3 (t+h)^2 \n\ns(t+h) = 1/3 (t^2 + 2th + h^2 )\n\nLet s(t+h) represent the position at a distance away from t final \n\nLet s(t) = the position at t final\n\nLet h equal the elapsed time between two distances \n\nLimit h -> 0 [ s(t+h) - s(t)]/ h\n\nNotice how this equation represents a slope (average velocity) created by two different points (x2-x1)/(y2-y1). Then the limit applied creates the slope of exactly one point (tangent line) -> that is, when the distance between two points reaches 0\n\nLet‚Äôs now substitute with what we know:\n\nLimit h -> 0 [ 1/3 (t^2 + 2th + h^2 ) - (1/3 ‚Ä¢ t^2) ]/ h\n\nLimit h -> 0 [ (2/3 ‚Ä¢ th + 1/3 ‚Ä¢ h^2 ) ]/ h\n\nLimit h -> 0 [ h(2/3 ‚Ä¢ t + 1/3 ‚Ä¢ h)]/h\n\nSimplify \n\nLimit h->0 [2/3 ‚Ä¢t + 1/3 ‚Ä¢ h]\n\nYou can now substitute 0 for h\n\nLimit h->0 [2/3 ‚Ä¢t + 1/3 ‚Ä¢ h] = 2/3 ‚Ä¢ t + (1/3 ‚Ä¢ 0)\n=2/3 t\n\nv(t) = 2/3 t now represents the slope of the tangent line at any time t, which also represents instantaneous velocity at any point t']",-0.0383928571428571,,0,74,0.25,5,3,1,12,2024,HomeworkHelp-1h5gmwy.png,1

Culturally, there are differences, but not as if you visited Japan and France.  It\'s more like you visited Latvia and Estonia. \n\nOne notable thing about cooperating politics is that political movement in central Asia has never been very advanced, at least for the last couple of centuries. So, thinking that:""they hate to be with Russia"" is quite wrong. If you ask in general our opinion on the war, we\'d be like:""Eh... it is not what we are bothered about.

Here are some top tips for posting high-quality feedback.\n\n* Read their context comment. All work on this sub should have a comment explaining the thinking behind the piece. Read this before posting \nto understand what LessChildhood3001 was trying to do.\n\n* Be professional. No matter your thoughts on the work, respect the effort put into making it and be polite when posting. \n\n* Be constructive and detailed. Short, vague comments are unhelpful. Instead of just leaving your opinion on the piece, explore *why* you hold that opinion: what makes the piece good or bad? How could it be improved? Are some elements stronger than others?\n\n* Remember design fundamentals. If your feedback is focused on basic principles of design such as hierarchy, flow, balance, and proportion, it will be universally useful. And remember that this is graphic design: the piece should communicate a message or solve a \nproblem. How well does it do that?\n\n* Stay on-topic. We know that design can sometimes be political or controversial, but please keep comments focussed on the design itself, \nand the strengths/weaknesses thereof. \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

(e.g. buying overload supplies 2 months ahead, or selling overload supplies on day 0 of dxp)\n\ni normally would start buying up all the summoning pouches i can steal on day 1, because everyone would just want to dump them to ge. waaaay below mid/shard price so i'd get as much as i can, convert pouches to shards for a quick cheeky 50 mill per 4 hour buy limit."", ""Oh god the traditional DXP format. Back in 2015-2018, I tried to get 5.4B exp on my old account. Every time it was announced, I was instantly booking time off work and preparing all my snack meals for that whole weekend. Looking back at my adventure logs, I crammed 40-50 hours every single weekend. Given that it was only 2-3 times per year, I spent most of my play time preparing funds for DXP. At the time, I couldn't PvM so I was forced to find the most profitable and fastest exp/h methods, which were Vyres. I was constantly price-watching to see if those skilling supplies were going to crash. I even spent my money on supplies months in advance just to get it for the best deals. It was the endless cycle of prepare -> dxp -> empty bank -> refuel bank -> buy supplies -> dxp. \n\nFast-forward to 2023 on a fresh account, I tried the new format for the first time. I'm so glad it happened. It standardized every weekend-based event over a course of a week instead of a single weekend (ie Winter 2017 event). I can't even use up 30 hours in a span of 10 days, let alone cramming an entire weekend anymore. Not to mention I don't need to prepare much in advance. Skilling supplies don't spike as badly as before so it's way healthier and more stable for the economy. You could pretty much get them at a discount if you train your buyables in the 2nd half of the period. Even being able to turn off the timer just to farm a missing charms is very QoL. Or making money during DXP when you were short on funds. With a pause button, you could flick it off to making money -> burning it for buyables. It was a much needed change. Cramming almost your entire active playerbase into 3 days just isn't good for your physical and mental health. You can't even take a break without *exp wasting*. People these days value their mental health more with regard to gaming than in year's past. As more of the playerbase grows into busy adults, it's just not feasible to give 3 days of pure FOMO. \n\nHowever, I personally think 4 DXP events is way too much. Maybe max 3 would give skilling some value but it has been heavily devalued by countless overpowered TH lamp promos. I do miss various citadels hosting portables. It brought more than a clan some community. We would see conversations struck up. But now it's mostly quiet despite larger clusters at crowded worlds of Fort. \n\nAlso, we specifically didn't get the pause button until a year after but you're otherwise correct. Going from 3 days and stretching to 10 days was huge."", 'So glad they switched it.

Since FPTP makes any threshold for entry to the parliament useless, the current coalitions probably wouldn't exist.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2023 AKP got 35.61%, CHP got 25.33%, and YSP got 8.82% of all votes; with FPTP method, they got 70%, 18.5% and 11.5% of the seats, respectively.\n\n**What does a 420-seat-majority mean?**\n\nGrand National Assembly of Turkey requires 400 MPs to pass a constitutional amendment or impeach the President, which is the highest threshold for any parliamentary procedure.

Like buying bundle with A+B, B+C would work because A+B would add to cart and then new bundle would contribute only C. But under new cart system it will complain that B is already in cart and block purchase. The logic to resolve overlapping bundles completely disappeared and you have to buy them one at a time :(\n\nNow you may be asking why this is relevant to you, since you\'re not buying bundles.

Once a bustling hub of religious and administrative activities for the Lima Culture, this site has become one of Metropolitan Lima's main tourist attractions and the city's most extensively investigated archaeological site. As visitors explore its enigmatic structures, they journey through time, unveiling the mysteries of a civilization that flourished on the central coast of Peru centuries ago.\n\nThe present-day Huaca Pucllana site spans approximately 6 hectares (15 acres), a fraction of its former expanse. Early neglect and development led to the destruction of valuable evidence and smaller pyramids. However, the surviving structures offer a captivating glimpse into the ingenuity and cultural richness of the ancient Lima Culture.\n\nThe Great Pyramid is at the heart of the site. It is a towering 25-meter (82-foot) adobe structure built in seven staggered platforms around 500 AD. This imposing edifice served as a ceremonial and administrative center where the Lima Culture's elite would gather for religious ceremonies, sacrifices, and offerings.\n\nSurrounding the pyramid is a central plaza, divided into two sections by a large structured wall. One section features benches and deep pits, where ceremonies and rituals are performed. The public spaces were adorned with vibrant yellow hues, signifying their importance in bringing together the elite for ceremonies that strengthened social cohesion and honored ancestors and deities.""]",0.113531746031746,,0,78,0.0,5,1,5,6,2024,archaeology-1d5fjij.jpeg,1

But putting a 0 at the end was useful in the 1970s because it takes less space and allows whole files to end with only 1 byte to mark its length, which matters when they have 16kB of RAM.\n\n**The modern approach:**\n\nIn modern programming, we believe in doing strings with a length+pointer struct.  This makes the operation more secure, more friendly to memory management, and finding the length is now a O(1) operation that doesn\'t require loading up the memory page the string is actually in.  Further, you can store strings inside other strings when they are const, allowing compression, and allowing you to hold both a string of the file and a string of its current line without having to copy the line out first.', 'This makes no sense.

For the limit as x approaches negative infinity from the graph, ask yourself, as x approaches negative infinity, where is the y value approaching? Same deal for positive infinity.
